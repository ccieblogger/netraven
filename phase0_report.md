# Phase 0: UI Testing Refactoring Report

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Base Page Class
- Modified `BasePage` to use configuration from environment variables
- Implemented container-based paths for artifacts
- Removed hardcoded values in favor of configuration

### 2. Fixed Test Files
- Updated `test_rate_limiting.py` to use proper imports
- Removed unnecessary login page dependency

### 3. Created Container-Based Testing Scripts
- Added `run_ui_tests.sh` script for running tests in containers
- Updated `build_test_env.sh` for proper test environment setup

### 4. Updated Docker Configuration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to properly set environment variables
- Created `docker-compose.override.yml` for test-specific settings
- Added volume mounts for test artifacts

### 5. Updated Dependencies
- Added Playwright to test requirements
- Ensured proper browser installation in test containers

## Page Objects Implemented

The following page objects are now available for testing:
- `BasePage`: Core functionality for all page objects
- `AuthPage`: Authentication-related operations (login, token management)
- `UserPage`: User management operations
- `DevicesPage`: Device CRUD operations
- `TagsPage`: Tag management operations
- `LoginPage`: Login-specific operations

## Next Steps

To utilize the refactored test framework:

1. Build the test environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_test_env.sh
   ```

2. Run UI tests:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_ui_tests.sh tests/ui
   ```

3. Run specific test files:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_ui_tests.sh tests/ui/test_flows/test_user_management.py
   ```

## Remaining Work

The following work remains to fully implement the UI testing strategy:
1. Create backup management page objects and tests
2. Implement job management page objects and tests
3. Develop gateway management page objects and tests
4. Create cross-resource workflow tests
