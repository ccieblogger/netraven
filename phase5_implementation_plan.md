# Phase 5: API and UI Integration - Implementation Plan

## Completed Tasks:

1. **Store Implementation**
   - Created a Pinia store for credential management (`credential.js`)
   - Created a Pinia store for tag management (`tag.js`)
   - Implemented actions for CRUD operations, tag associations, and statistics

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Added a new endpoint in `credentials.py` router for retrieving credential statistics
   - Added schema for credential statistics in `credential.py` schema file
   - Implemented CRUD logic in the backend for fetching credential statistics

3. **UI Components**
   - Created a credential dashboard component (`CredentialDashboard.vue`)
   - Updated existing `CredentialList.vue` to use the new Pinia store
   - Added navigation links to the credential dashboard

4. **API Client**
   - Updated API client with methods for managing credential tags
   - Added method for retrieving credential statistics

## Next Steps:

1. **Testing**
   - Test the new API endpoints with Postman or similar tool
   - Verify that credential statistics are calculated correctly
   - Test the credential dashboard with real data

2. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation to include the new endpoints
   - Document the credential statistics data structure
   - Update user documentation to cover the new credential dashboard

3. **Future Enhancements (Phase 6)**
   - Implement additional credential performance graphs
   - Add filtering capabilities to the credential dashboard
   - Add ability to test credentials in bulk
   - Implement automated credential rotation for security

## Dependencies and Requirements:

- The credential store implementation in `netraven/core/credential_store.py`
- Database models for credentials and credential tags
- Existing API endpoints for basic credential CRUD operations

## Timeline:

- Phase 5 implementation: Completed
- Testing: 1 day
- Documentation updates: 0.5 day
- Total duration: 1.5 days
