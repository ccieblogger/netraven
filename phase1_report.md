# Phase 1 Report: Verifying UI Tests

## Current Status

We have successfully set up the basic test environment, but encountered some issues that need to be addressed:

### Working Components
1. API container is running successfully
2. Frontend container is running (though marked as unhealthy)
3. Database container is running successfully
4. Test-specific configuration file has been created (`config.test.yml`)
5. Fixed module import issues in test files by:
   - Creating proper `__init__.py` files in test directories
   - Converting relative imports to absolute imports

### Issues to Fix

1. **Scheduler Container**: 
   - Currently fails to start due to missing Python dependencies
   - Needs a proper Docker build instead of using basic Python image

2. **Frontend Connectivity**:
   - The UI tests can't connect to the frontend container properly
   - Tests are timing out when trying to find login form elements
   - Frontend container is marked as unhealthy in docker-compose

3. **Test Configuration**:
   - Need to verify that `conftest.py` correctly sets up test environment
   - Ensure fixtures are properly configured

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Created Test-Specific Dockerfile**:
   - Created `Dockerfile.tests` with all required dependencies for UI testing
   - Includes Playwright and browser dependencies
   - Pre-configured with environment variables for testing

2. **Created Test Runner Scripts**:
   - `scripts/run_ui_tests.sh`: Builds and runs tests in a dedicated container
   - `scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh`: Runs tests with the dedicated container while using the network of the existing environment
   - Both scripts generate HTML reports in the `test-artifacts` directory

3. **Fixed Module Structure**:
   - Created proper `__init__.py` files in test directories
   - Updated imports in key test files for proper module resolution

4. **Test Configuration File**:
   - Created `config.test.yml` with specific settings for the test environment
   - Updated `docker-compose.override.yml` to use this configuration

## Test Results

Initial test execution revealed several issues:

1. **Connection Issues**:
   - The test container cannot connect to the frontend container
   - Tests fail with `Timeout 10000ms exceeded` when trying to find login elements
   - Screenshots show that the frontend is not rendering properly

2. **Container Networking**:
   - While the containers are on the same network, there may be issues with name resolution or service availability
   - The frontend container is marked as unhealthy, which may be contributing to the connection issues

3. **Docker Environment**:
   - The Docker environment is mostly working correctly
   - API container is healthy and reachable
   - Frontend container needs investigation for proper health

## Next Steps for Phase 2

1. **Fix Frontend Container**:
   - Investigate why the frontend container is unhealthy
   - Check logs and health check configuration
   - Ensure the frontend is properly serving the login page

2. **Update Network Configuration**:
   - Verify that the test container can properly connect to the frontend
   - Update Docker networking configuration if necessary
   - Add debug logging to trace connection issues

3. **Update Test Configuration**:
   - Modify test fixtures to better handle connection failures
   - Add retry mechanisms for flaky tests
   - Improve error reporting with more detailed screenshots

4. **Verify Frontend Structure**:
   - Check that the frontend is rendering the login form with the expected selectors
   - Update selectors in tests if the UI has changed
   - Add debug logging to verify HTML structure

5. **Create Comprehensive Testing Guide**:
   - Document the testing process with examples
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - Add detailed configuration instructions

## How to Run Tests

To run the UI tests in a dedicated container that connects to the test environment:

```bash
# Start the test environment
./scripts/build_test_env.sh

# Run UI tests in a dedicated container
./scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh

# To run specific tests
./scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh -p tests/ui/test_flows/test_login.py
```

Test reports will be available in the `test-artifacts` directory, along with screenshots of any failures for debugging.
