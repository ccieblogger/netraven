# Phase 1 Report: UI Testing Restoration

## Approach Correction

We've reverted to the original testing approach as specified in DEVELOPER.md and testing.md:

1. **Single Environment Testing**:
   - Using `NETRAVEN_ENV=test` to activate test mode
   - Running tests in the API container with `docker exec netraven-api-1 python -m pytest`
   - No separate test containers, Dockerfiles, or custom configuration files

2. **Removed Custom Components**:
   - Removed `Dockerfile.tests` (not part of original approach)
   - Removed custom testing scripts (`verify_ui_tests.sh`, `run_ui_tests.sh`)
   - Removed custom configuration file (`config.test.yml`)
   - Restored original `docker-compose.override.yml`

3. **Reverted to Documented Workflow**:
   - Updated `build_test_env.sh` to match original approach
   - Using standard `docker exec` commands to run tests within API container

## Retained Helpful Changes

We kept the following beneficial changes that align with best practices:

1. **Module Structure**:
   - `__init__.py` files added to test directories for proper module resolution
   - Fixed imports in test files to use absolute imports

## Current Status

The environment is now returned to its original state, which follows NetRaven's testing strategy:

1. **Docker Environment**:
   - Single test mode activated with environment variable
   - API container includes necessary test dependencies

2. **Test Organization**:
   - UI tests in `tests/ui` directory
   - Test fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/ui/conftest.py`

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Test Environment**:
   - Run `./scripts/build_test_env.sh` to set up the proper test environment
   - Verify all containers start correctly

2. **Run and Debug Basic Tests**:
   - Run `docker exec netraven-api-1 python -m pytest tests/ui/test_flows/test_login.py -v` 
   - Debug any issues with proper tools and logging
   - Ensure fixture setup is correct

3. **Complete Test Coverage**:
   - Implement missing tests for user management and rate limiting 
   - Ensure all tests follow the documented testing approach

4. **Document Process**:
   - Add detailed information about UI test structure
   - Document common issues and their solutions

Following NetRaven's principle of "test as you develop," we'll continue adding tests that validate the functionality of all user-facing components, now within the correct testing framework.
