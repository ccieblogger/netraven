# Phase 1 Report: Verifying UI Tests

## Current Status

We have successfully set up the basic test environment, but encountered some issues that need to be addressed:

### Working Components
1. API container is running successfully
2. Frontend container is running (though marked as unhealthy)
3. Database container is running successfully
4. Test-specific configuration file has been created (`config.test.yml`)
5. Fixed module import issues in test files by:
   - Creating proper `__init__.py` files in test directories
   - Converting relative imports to absolute imports

### Issues to Fix

1. **Scheduler Container**: 
   - Currently fails to start due to missing Python dependencies
   - Needs a proper Docker build instead of using basic Python image

2. **Playwright Browser Installation**:
   - Browser binaries need to be installed in the test container
   - Need to add this step to the build process

3. **Import Structure**: 
   - Fixed basic imports, but may need to update more files

4. **Test Configuration**:
   - Need to verify that `conftest.py` correctly sets up test environment
   - Ensure fixtures are properly configured

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Created Test-Specific Dockerfile**:
   - Created `Dockerfile.tests` with all required dependencies for UI testing
   - Includes Playwright and browser dependencies
   - Pre-configured with environment variables for testing

2. **Created Test Runner Scripts**:
   - `scripts/run_ui_tests.sh`: Builds and runs tests in a dedicated container
   - `scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh`: Runs tests in the existing API container after installing dependencies
   - Both scripts generate HTML reports in the `test-artifacts` directory

3. **Fixed Module Structure**:
   - Created proper `__init__.py` files in test directories
   - Updated imports in key test files for proper module resolution

4. **Test Configuration File**:
   - Created `config.test.yml` with specific settings for the test environment
   - Updated `docker-compose.override.yml` to use this configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Tests**:
   - Run the `verify_ui_tests.sh` script to verify the login tests
   - Fix any remaining issues with test configuration or imports

2. **Improve Docker Configuration**:
   - Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to use specific containers for UI testing
   - Create a dedicated test environment that doesn't require manual setup

3. **Fix Frontend Container Health**:
   - Investigate why the frontend container is marked as unhealthy
   - Update health check configuration if necessary

4. **Fix Scheduler Issues**:
   - Create a proper Docker image for the scheduler with dependencies
   - Update the scheduler command to use the correct module path

## Detailed Test Execution Plan

Once the environment issues are fixed, the following tests will be verified:

1. **Login Functionality**:
   - Basic login with valid/invalid credentials
   - Form validation
   - Token persistence

2. **User Management**:
   - User creation, editing, and deletion
   - Form validation
   - Permission management

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Login attempt limits
   - Cooldown periods
   - Brute force protection

These tests will verify that the core functionality of the application works as expected and that the UI testing framework is properly configured.

## How to Run Tests

To run the UI tests in the existing environment:

```bash
# Start the test environment
./scripts/build_test_env.sh

# Run UI tests in the API container
./scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh

# To run specific tests
./scripts/verify_ui_tests.sh -p tests/ui/test_flows/test_login.py
```

To run tests in a dedicated container (without needing to start the environment):

```bash
# Build and run tests in a dedicated container
./scripts/run_ui_tests.sh

# To run specific tests
./scripts/run_ui_tests.sh -p tests/ui/test_flows/test_login.py
```

Test reports will be available in the `test-artifacts` directory.
