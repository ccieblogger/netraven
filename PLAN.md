# Integration Plan for Job Tracking and Notification Services

## Phase 1: Service Layer Implementation ✅
- [x] Create job notification service (`notification_service.py`)
- [x] Implement job tracking service (`job_tracking_service.py`) 
- [x] Update scheduler service to use job tracking (`scheduler_service.py`)
- [x] Update the scheduler to support the new job tracking architecture

## Phase 2: API Layer Integration ✅
- [x] Update job log router to expose job tracking information
- [x] Add API endpoints for tracking active jobs
- [x] Add API endpoints for job statistics
- [x] Implement notification preferences settings for users

## Phase 3: UI Integration
- [ ] Add job status monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Create notification preferences UI
- [ ] Implement real-time job status updates
- [ ] Add email notification templates

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Create unit tests for the notification service
- [ ] Create unit tests for the job tracking service
- [ ] Update integration tests for the scheduler service
- [ ] Update API documentation with new endpoints
- [ ] Create user documentation for notification settings

## Implementation Details

### Job Tracking Service
The job tracking service (`job_tracking_service.py`) provides:
- Start/stop tracking of job execution
- Job status updates and logging
- Job retry logic
- Detailed job statistics

### Notification Service
The notification service (`notification_service.py`) provides:
- Email notifications for job completion/failure
- Configurable notification templates
- Framework for future notification channels (web, SMS, etc.)

### Integration Points
1. **Scheduler Service**: Uses job tracking for all scheduled jobs
2. **Job Log Router**: Extended to provide access to tracking data via new endpoints:
   - `/job-logs/active` - Lists all currently active jobs
   - `/job-logs/statistics` - Provides job execution statistics
3. **User Preferences**: Added to the user model with new API endpoint:
   - `/users/{user_id}/notification-preferences` - Updates user notification settings

### Next Steps
1. Implement the UI components for job status monitoring
2. Create UI for notification preferences
3. Add real-time job status updates using WebSockets
