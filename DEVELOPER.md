# NetRaven Developer Documentation

## Product Overview

NetRaven is a **product** designed to be shipped to customers, not a service or production environment. It is packaged as a collection of Docker containers that customers deploy in their own environments. This fundamental characteristic drives our development, testing, and deployment approach.

Key product principles:
- All components are delivered as Docker containers via a docker-compose configuration
- There is a single environment configuration intended for shipping to customers
- All changes must be reflected in the source code and container setup files
- The product must be consistent and reproducible across all customer installations

## Deployment Model

### Single Environment Approach

NetRaven uses a single environment configuration approach:
- Unlike typical development workflows with dev/staging/prod environments, NetRaven ships as a single environment
- All configuration is contained in the docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles, and config.yml
- Environment-specific settings are handled through configuration file parameters and environment variables
- This approach ensures that what we test is exactly what customers receive

### Container-Based Architecture

The product is delivered as a set of interconnected containers:
- API Service: Core backend functionality
- Device Gateway: Secure device communication
- Frontend: User interface
- PostgreSQL Database: Data storage
- Scheduler: Background job processing

All components must function within this containerized model, with appropriate inter-service communication.

## Recent Issue Fixes

### Authentication System Fixes (Updated)

#### JWT Token Validation Improvements

**Problem**: The JWT token validation process was failing after api/frontend restarts due to token store persistence issues.

**Fix**:
- Enhanced token validation in `netraven/core/auth.py` to add development-mode fallback mechanisms
- Added token debugging code to log token contents and validation process
- Modified `TokenStore` class in `netraven/core/token_store.py` to handle token persistence more reliably
- Added environment-based default behavior, allowing development mode to use a more lenient validation approach
- Added `NETRAVEN_ENV` environment variable to control token validation behavior

**Example**:
```python
# Development mode fallback for token validation
if os.environ.get("NETRAVEN_ENV", "").lower() in ("dev", "development", "testing", "test"):
    logger.info("Using development mode token validation")
    try:
        # Skip token store validation in dev mode
        payload = jwt.decode(token, TOKEN_SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[TOKEN_ALGORITHM])
        logger.info(f"Dev mode token validation succeeded for {payload.get('sub', 'unknown')}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Dev mode token validation failed: {str(e)}")
```

#### UserPrincipal Implementation Fixes

**Problem**: The `UserPrincipal` class was missing essential attributes needed by endpoint implementations.

**Fix**:
- Added `is_admin` attribute to `UserPrincipal` class in `netraven/web/auth/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  self.is_admin = user.is_active and ("admin:*" in user.permissions)
  self.id = user.username  # Add id attribute for compatibility
  ```
- Updated user permissions for admin user to include all required scopes:
  ```python
  permissions=["admin:*", "read:devices", "write:devices", "read:*", "write:*"]
  ```
- Fixed scope validation in endpoint handlers to use `has_scope` method

#### Router and Endpoint Consistency

**Problem**: Inconsistent router path definitions were causing "Method Not Allowed" errors.

**Fix**:
- Standardized all router path patterns to use "/" consistently:
  - Changed empty string paths `@router.post("")` to `@router.post("/")` 
  - Ensured all routes follow the same pattern
- Fixed endpoint handlers to properly process admin vs. regular user access:
  ```python
  # If user is admin, show all devices, otherwise just their own
  if current_principal.is_admin:
      return get_devices(db) 
  else:
      return get_devices(db, owner_id=current_principal.username)
  ```

#### Improved Error Handling

**Problem**: Generic 500 errors were returned instead of meaningful error messages.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive try/except blocks with detailed error messages
- Added logging for authentication and validation errors
- Implemented proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
- Enhanced debugging output for token validation issues

#### JWT Import and Decode Issues

**Problem**: The application was missing the JWT import in the web auth module and all `jwt.decode()` calls were missing the required `key` parameter.

**Fix**: 
- Added `from jose import jwt` import to `netraven/web/auth/__init__.py`
- Updated all `jwt.decode()` calls in the following files to include a dummy key parameter since verify_signature was set to false:
  - `netraven/web/auth/__init__.py`
  - `netraven/web/routers/auth.py`
  - `netraven/core/auth.py`

**Example**:
```python
# Before
token_data = jwt.decode(token, options={"verify_signature": False})

# After
token_data = jwt.decode(token, "dummy-key-not-used", options={"verify_signature": False})
```

#### Pydantic EmailStr Validation Issue

**Problem**: The User model was using `EmailStr` from Pydantic, but this was causing validation errors with Pydantic 2.4.2.

**Fix**: Updated the User model in `netraven/web/models/auth.py` to use a regular string instead:

```python
# Before
email: EmailStr = Field(..., description="User email address")

# After
email: str = Field(..., description="User email address")
```

#### CORS Configuration

**Problem**: CORS settings were not properly configured to allow requests from the frontend origins.

**Fix**: Updated the CORS middleware in `netraven/web/__init__.py` to explicitly allow frontend origins:

```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:8080",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
        "http://0.0.0.0:8080",
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

#### Frontend Request Format

**Problem**: The frontend was sending login credentials as form-urlencoded data, but the API expected JSON after the Pydantic upgrade.

**Fix**: Updated the login function in `netraven/web/frontend/src/api/api.js` to send JSON data:

```javascript
// Send JSON data instead of form data for Pydantic 2.x compatibility
const response = await axios.post(`${browserApiUrl}/api/auth/token`, {
  username: username,
  password: password
}, {
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  },
  withCredentials: false
});
```

### API Router Refactoring Implementation

The API Router refactoring that was previously identified as a future optimization has been implemented. This resolves the duplicate prefix issue that was causing paths like `/api/devices/devices`.

**Changes Implemented**:
1. Updated all router files to use consistent path patterns:
   - Router files no longer include their own name in the prefix
   - In router files: Use `router = APIRouter(prefix="", tags=["devices"])` 
   - In `api.py`: Use `api_router.include_router(devices.router, prefix="/devices")`
   - In `__init__.py`: Use `app.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")`

2. Fixed URL inconsistencies:
   - Standardized route definitions to use `/` instead of empty strings for root paths
   - Updated all endpoint handlers to properly work with the new URL structure
   - Ensured consistent patterns across all API endpoints

3. Improved error handling:
   - Added proper scope validation for protected endpoints
   - Added detailed error messages for authorization failures
   - Implemented better logging for debugging authentication issues

4. Results:
   - API URLs are now cleaner (e.g., `/api/devices` instead of `/api/devices/devices`)
   - Code structure is more maintainable
   - API structure is more intuitive for frontend consumers
   - Enhanced security with proper scope validation

## Current State of the Application

### Authentication System

The authentication system is now fully functional with the following features:

1. **JWT Token-based Authentication**:
   - Tokens include comprehensive user permissions as scopes
   - Development mode provides fallback mechanisms for token validation
   - Token store handles persistence correctly
   - Clear logging for debugging token issues

2. **User Permissions Structure**:
   - Admin users can access all resources with `admin:*` scope
   - Resource-specific scopes (read:devices, write:devices) for granular control
   - UserPrincipal class correctly implements is_admin attribute
   - Default admin user has all necessary permissions

3. **Login Process**:
   - Frontend successfully authenticates using admin/NetRaven credentials
   - Tokens are properly generated and validated
   - Frontend stores tokens in localStorage
   - Subsequent requests include token in Authorization header

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - All endpoints use consistent URL patterns
   - Protected endpoints validate user permissions
   - Admin users have access to all resources
   - Regular users only see their own resources

### Known Limitations

1. **Token Persistence**: In development mode, tokens may need to be re-acquired after container restarts
2. **Database Initialization**: First-time setup requires default users to be created
3. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may still return generic error messages

### Testing Authentication

When testing authentication, use the following:
- Username: admin
- Password: NetRaven

All API endpoints requiring authentication can be tested with a valid token:
```bash
# Get token
curl -L -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin", "password":"NetRaven"}'

# Use token to access protected endpoint
curl -L -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/users/me
```

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### Token Refresh Mechanism

Consider implementing a token refresh mechanism to allow for longer sessions without requiring re-login:

1. **Proposed Implementation**:
   - Add a `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint that accepts a valid token
   - Return a new token with extended expiration
   - Revoke the original token

2. **Benefits**:
   - Improved user experience
   - More secure than long-lived tokens
   - Reduced login frequency

### Enhanced Token Store

The token store could be improved for better performance and reliability:

1. **Proposed Enhancements**:
   - Add Redis backend option for token storage
   - Implement token cleanup for expired tokens
   - Add metrics for token usage and revocation

2. **Benefits**:
   - Better performance for high-volume deployments
   - Improved reliability across container restarts
   - Better visibility into authentication patterns

### Audit Logging

Authentication events should be logged for security purposes:

1. **Proposed Implementation**:
   - Log all authentication attempts (success/failure)
   - Track token issuance, usage, and revocation
   - Store logs in a dedicated audit log database

2. **Benefits**:
   - Improved security monitoring
   - Compliance with security best practices
   - Better debugging for authentication issues

## Development Guidelines

### Change Implementation Process

When implementing changes to NetRaven, always follow these principles:

1. **Container Setup Changes**: All changes must be incorporated into the container setup files (Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml) and source code, not directly in running containers
   
2. **No Direct Container Modifications**: Avoid making changes directly to running containers. Any temporary modifications for testing must ultimately be implemented in the base configuration files

3. **Debugging Approach**: 
   - You are encouraged to use all necessary troubleshooting techniques, including:
     - Adding temporary logging
     - Running diagnostic commands inside containers
     - Using container exec to inspect the environment
     - Installing temporary debugging tools when needed
   - While direct container modification should be minimized, it is acceptable when necessary for effective diagnosis
   - **Track all temporary changes** with clear comments (e.g., `# TEMPORARY: Added for debugging issue #123`)
   - Document any significant temporary modifications made during troubleshooting
   - After resolving issues, implement the proper permanent fix in the source code and configuration files
   - **Remove all temporary debugging code** before submitting the final fix
   - Return the codebase to its original state, with only the necessary fixes implemented
   - Consider adding better logging or monitoring for similar issues in the future

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - All configurable aspects should be exposed through config.yml
   - Sensitive configurations should support environment variable injection
   - Default configurations should be sensible for most deployments

5. **Versioning**:
   - All changes must be tracked with proper versioning
   - Docker images should be tagged consistently with the product version
   - Database schema changes must include proper migrations

## Coding Preferences

All development work on NetRaven should adhere to these coding preferences:

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible; check the codebase for similar code or functionality and leverage that before introducing something new
- Only make changes that are requested or related to the change being requested
- When fixing a bug or issue, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without exhausting all options with the existing implementation
- If you need to introduce a new pattern or technology, make sure to remove the old implementation to prevent duplicate logic and legacy code
- Always consider the project deployment model when introducing changes to ensure they are properly incorporated
- Always clean up after yourself; remove temporary files or code when no longer needed
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if they'll only be used once or temporarily
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code; refactor at that point
- Mocking data should only be used for tests, never for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects dev or prod
- Present a plan outlining proposed changes when initially asked to update, enhance, create, or fix an issue, and wait for approval before proceeding
- Break plans into phases to avoid making too many changes at once
- Always ask if you can proceed before moving on to the next phase
- Always git state, commit, and push after every successful completion of a phase
- Explain what you are doing as you code, test, or make changes, without being too verbose

## Architecture Overview

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits login credentials to `/api/auth/token`
2. API validates credentials and generates a JWT token
3. JWT token includes user permissions as scopes
4. Frontend stores token in localStorage
5. Subsequent requests include token in Authorization header
6. API validates token and extracts principal
7. Optional auth endpoints allow unauthenticated access but provide principal if token is present

### Component Communication

```
Frontend App
    │
    ▼
API Service
    │
    ▼
Device Gateway ◄─► Network Devices
    │
    ▼
PostgreSQL Database
```

- API and Gateway services communicate over HTTP
- Services use the same token for authentication (pass-through)
- Gateway endpoints now accept unauthenticated requests for status and metrics

## Testing

### Product Testing Approach

Testing for NetRaven should simulate the actual customer deployment experience:

1. **Clean Environment Testing**: 
   - Always test in a clean environment that matches what customers will use
   - Use docker-compose to bring up the entire stack from scratch
   - Verify that initialization processes work properly

2. **Configuration Testing**:
   - Test with various configuration settings to ensure flexibility
   - Verify that environment variable overrides work as expected
   - Test upgrade scenarios from previous versions

3. **Authentication Testing**: 
   - When testing authentication, use the following:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: NetRaven

4. **Persistence Testing**:
   - Test with persistent volumes to ensure data survives container restarts
   - Verify backup and restore functionality

## Shipping and Deployment

### Preparing for Release

When preparing NetRaven for shipping to customers:

1. **Version Tagging**:
   - Ensure all components have consistent version numbers
   - Tag all Docker images with the correct version
   - Update version references in documentation

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Ensure installation instructions are current and accurate
   - Document any new features or configuration options
   - Update troubleshooting guides with new known issues

3. **Final Testing**:
   - Perform a complete "customer installation" test using only the shipping artifacts
   - Verify all components work together as expected
   - Test upgrade paths from previous versions

### Deployment Requirements

Document clear requirements for customer deployment:
- Docker and Docker Compose version requirements
- Minimum hardware specifications
- Network requirements and ports
- Persistent volume considerations

## Common Issues

1. **JWT decode errors**: Ensure all `jwt.decode()` calls include the key parameter
2. **CORS errors**: Check allow_origins in CORSMiddleware configuration
3. **Container connectivity**: Use service names not localhost
4. **Authentication failures**: Check token format and expiration
5. **Vue.js component errors**: Ensure proper template/script structure

## Contributing

When contributing to NetRaven, follow these guidelines:

1. **Branch Management**:
   - Create a new branch for your feature
   - Base branches on the current release branch
   - Use descriptive branch names (feature/xxx, bugfix/xxx)

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update existing tests for modified functionality
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting
   - Follow the established coding style

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation for any changes
   - Add examples for new features
   - Document API changes in the OpenAPI specification

4. **Review Process**:
   - Submit a pull request for review
   - Address all review comments
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass

5. **Deployment Consideration**:
   - Consider how your changes affect the deployment model
   - Update container configurations as needed
   - Document any deployment impact

6. **Cleanup**:
   - Remove all temporary debugging code
   - Ensure the codebase is clean and adheres to coding preferences
   - Use clear commit messages describing the changes 

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### API Routing Structure Refactoring

The current API routing structure has some prefix duplication, which could be optimized in the future:

1. **Current Implementation**:
   - In router files (e.g., `devices.py`): `router = APIRouter(prefix="/devices", tags=["devices"])`
   - In `api.py`: `api_router.include_router(devices.router, prefix="/devices")`
   - In `__init__.py`: `app.include_router(api_router, prefix="/api")`
   - This results in URLs like `/api/devices/devices` instead of the cleaner `/api/devices`

2. **Potential Solutions**:
   - Standardize the router prefixes to avoid duplication
   - Create a more consistent routing hierarchy
   - Implement a router factory pattern that automatically handles prefix management

3. **Benefits**:
   - Cleaner API URLs
   - Improved code maintainability
   - Better developer experience
   - More intuitive API structure for frontend consumers

This optimization should be considered during a future refactoring sprint.
