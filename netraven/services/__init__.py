"""Services for the NetRaven application.

This package contains business logic services that implement the core functionality
of the NetRaven application. These services abstract database operations and
implement business rules, providing a clean separation between the API layer
and the data access layer.

Services typically orchestrate operations involving multiple models and implement
key business logic that doesn't belong in the API layer or data models.
