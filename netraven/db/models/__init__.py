"""Database models for the NetRaven application.

This package contains SQLAlchemy ORM models that define the database schema
and relationships between entities in the NetRaven system. These models form
the core data structure of the application, representing network devices,
credentials, jobs, configurations, and their relationships.

The models use SQLAlchemy's declarative base pattern and include relationship
definitions that establish the connections between different entities.
