"""Backend drivers for device communication.

This package contains the different backend drivers used to communicate with
network devices. Each backend implements a specific protocol or method for
interacting with devices, such as SSH, API, or other connectivity methods.

The backends are designed to be interchangeable, allowing the system to use
different communication methods based on device requirements while providing
a consistent interface to the rest of the application.
