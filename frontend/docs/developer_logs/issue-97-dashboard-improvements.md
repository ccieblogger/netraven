- Adjusted padding in the device inventory card and its header/filter form for a tighter layout.

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.vue`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/KpiCard.vue`

#### Details
- Changed KPI card row from `px-2 mb-8` to `px-0 mb-4`.
- Added `aspect-square h-32` to KPI cards for square shape.
- Reduced device inventory card padding from `px-2` to `px-0`.
- Reduced header and filter form padding for the device inventory card.
- Added `min-h-0 min-w-0` to KPI card root for better aspect ratio support.

#### Next Steps
- Phase 3: Test layout on various screen sizes and validate visual improvements.
