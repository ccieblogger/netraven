# Developer Log: Dashboard Refactor (2025)

## Date: 2025-05-01

### Summary
- **Removed** the "Recent Jobs" section from `Dashboard.vue` as per UI/UX update request.
- **Moved up** the Device Inventory section to occupy the space.
- **Reduced padding** in the Device Inventory area for a denser, more modern layout, using PrimeFlex best practices.

### Rationale
- Aligns with 2025 PrimeVue 4+ and Vue 3 UI/UX best practices: minimal, responsive, and information-dense dashboards.
- Reduces visual clutter and improves focus on device inventory, which is the primary dashboard function.
- Uses utility classes for spacing instead of custom or excessive padding.

### Next Steps
- Review the updated dashboard in the browser for layout and spacing.
- Solicit feedback from stakeholders for further UI/UX tweaks.
- If approved, proceed to commit and push changes to the feature branch.
