# NetRaven

**Network Device Configuration Backup & Audit System**  
*Proof-of-Concept: 100% AI-Coded by LLMs (Claude 3.5, 3.7, GPT-4.1) under Human Prompt Engineering*

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

NetRaven is a multi-service, containerized platform for automated network device configuration backup, versioning, and audit.  
It was developed as a proof-of-concept to explore the capabilities of modern AI (LLMs) in end-to-end software engineering.

**Key facts:**
- All code was generated by AI (Claude 3.5, 3.7, GPT-4.1) based on prompts and architecture by a human prompt engineer.
- The primary IDE used for this project was **Cursor AI**, enabling a modern, AI-assisted development workflow.
- The project demonstrates that a complex, multi-service application can be designed and implemented entirely by AI, with human-in-the-loop guidance.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Device Backups:** Retrieve running configs and device facts via SSH (Netmiko/Paramiko).
- **Git Versioning:** Store every config snapshot in a local Git repo for full audit/history.
- **Job Scheduling:** One-time and recurring jobs, managed by RQ + RQ Scheduler.
- **REST API:** FastAPI backend for all CRUD and job operations.
- **Role-Based UI:** Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia frontend for inventory, jobs, logs, and diffs.
- **Unified Logging:** All events (job, connection, system) in a single, filterable log.
- **Secure by Default:** JWT authentication, role-based access, encrypted credentials.
- **Containerized:** Runs only via Docker Compose for consistency and reproducibility.

```

**All services run as containers.**  
See [`docs/architecture/architecture_sot.md`](docs/architecture/architecture_sot.md) for full details.

### Core Containers

- `nginx` (reverse proxy)
- `frontend` (Vue 3 app)
- `api` (FastAPI backend)
- `worker` (RQ worker for device jobs)
- `postgres` (PostgreSQL 14)
- `redis` (Redis 7)
- `scheduler` (RQ Scheduler, if separate)

## ü§ñ AI-Driven Development

This project was coded entirely by AI (Claude 3.5, 3.7, GPT-4.1) under the guidance of a human prompt engineer and architect.  
The primary IDE used throughout development was **Cursor AI**, enabling seamless AI-assisted coding, refactoring, and documentation.
It was undertaken as a learning experiment to test the limits of LLM-driven software engineering for complex, multi-service systems.

**Reflections:**
- All architectural decisions, code, and documentation were generated by LLMs.
- The human role was to prompt, review, and steer the process.
- The result demonstrates the viability‚Äîand current limitations‚Äîof AI-driven development for real-world, multi-container applications.
