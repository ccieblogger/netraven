# Phase 2: Scheduler Service Implementation

## Overview
The Scheduler Service is a critical component of the NetRaven architecture redesign. It provides centralized device interaction and job scheduling capabilities, allowing for a unified interface for executing tasks across devices. This service will consolidate scheduling logic that is currently spread across multiple components.

## Initial Assessment

The current scheduling functionality is spread across several components:
- `netraven/jobs/scheduler.py` - Contains the `BackupScheduler` class that handles scheduling and executing backup jobs
- `netraven/web/services/scheduler_service.py` - Contains the web interface for scheduling jobs

The new design will consolidate these into a single centralized Scheduler Service that provides:
- A unified job model and queue
- Pluggable task handlers for different job types
- Support for immediate, one-time, and recurring scheduled jobs
- Priority-based job execution
- Comprehensive job status tracking and reporting

## Implementation Plan

1. Create core service components:
   - `Job` and `JobStatus` classes
   - `SchedulerService` class
   - `JobQueue` for prioritized job execution

2. Create task handler components:
   - Base interface for job handlers
   - Specific handlers for different job types (backup, command execution, etc.)

3. Integrate device communication:
   - Connect to the Device Service for executing device operations
   - Handle authentication and connection management

4. Implement scheduling logic:
   - Various schedule types (immediate, one-time, daily, weekly, etc.)
   - Job persistence and recovery

5. Create web service adapter:
   - Interface with the web application
   - Provide API for scheduling and monitoring jobs

## Implementation Log
