# Directory Structure Cleanup

## Overview

This document logs changes made as part of the directory structure cleanup effort. The goal is to simplify the codebase by removing redundant files/directories and organizing the code more logically.

## Router Consolidation

### Issue
The project had two different directories for routing:
- `netraven/web/routers/` - Main router directory with most endpoints
- `netraven/web/routes/` - Secondary directory containing only `gateway.py`

This created confusion about where to add new routes and how the routing system was organized.

### Changes Made
1. Compared functionality between `web/routes/gateway.py` and `web/routers/gateway.py`
2. Verified that `web/routes/gateway.py` was not imported or used anywhere
3. Verified all required functionality was already present in `web/routers/gateway.py`
4. Removed the redundant `web/routes/gateway.py` file
5. Removed the empty `web/routes` directory

### Impact
- Simplified directory structure
- Removed potential confusion for developers
- Eliminated a source of potential drift where changes might be made to one file but not the other

## Documentation Consolidation

### Issue
The project had documentation spread across multiple directories:
- `docs/` - Main documentation directory
- `aidocs/` - Secondary documentation directory 

This created confusion and made it difficult to find specific documentation.

### Changes Made
1. Verified that all content from `aidocs/` had been properly migrated to `docs/`
2. Verified the directory structure matched:
   - `aidocs/development_logs/` → `docs/development_logs/`
   - `aidocs/Implementation plans/` → `docs/implementation_plans/`
3. Removed the redundant `aidocs/` directory

### Impact
- Single source of truth for documentation
- Simplified documentation structure
- Made it easier for developers to find and maintain documentation

## Next Steps
- Continue with other directory structure cleanup tasks
- Ensure all tests pass with the simplified directory structure
