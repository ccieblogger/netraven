# Directory Structure Cleanup

## Overview

This document logs changes made as part of the directory structure cleanup effort. The goal is to simplify the codebase by removing redundant files/directories and organizing the code more logically.

## Router Consolidation

### Issue
The project had two different directories for routing:
- `netraven/web/routers/` - Main router directory with most endpoints
- `netraven/web/routes/` - Secondary directory containing only `gateway.py`

This created confusion about where to add new routes and how the routing system was organized.

### Changes Made
1. Compared functionality between `web/routes/gateway.py` and `web/routers/gateway.py`
2. Verified that `web/routes/gateway.py` was not imported or used anywhere
3. Verified all required functionality was already present in `web/routers/gateway.py`
4. Removed the redundant `web/routes/gateway.py` file
5. Removed the empty `web/routes` directory

### Impact
- Simplified directory structure
- Removed potential confusion for developers
- Eliminated a source of potential drift where changes might be made to one file but not the other

## Documentation Consolidation

### Issue
The project had documentation spread across multiple directories:
- `docs/` - Main documentation directory
- `aidocs/` - Secondary documentation directory 

This created confusion and made it difficult to find specific documentation.

### Changes Made
1. Verified that all content from `aidocs/` had been properly migrated to `docs/`
2. Verified the directory structure matched:
   - `aidocs/development_logs/` → `docs/development_logs/`
   - `aidocs/Implementation plans/` → `docs/implementation_plans/`
3. Removed the redundant `aidocs/` directory

### Impact
- Single source of truth for documentation
- Simplified documentation structure
- Made it easier for developers to find and maintain documentation

## Backend Directory Consolidation

### Issue
The project had backend code in two separate locations:
- `netraven/web/backend/` - Part of the main application package
- `backend/` - A separate top-level directory

This created confusion about where backend code should be placed and maintained.

### Analysis
The top-level `backend/` directory was:
- Mostly empty (only contained a `main.py` file and an empty `api/` directory)
- Not referenced elsewhere in the codebase
- Contained imports that referenced non-existent modules (`backend.api.auth`)
- Likely an abandoned or incomplete component

The `netraven/web/backend/` directory followed the established package structure pattern and was integrated into the main application.

### Changes Made
1. Examined both directories to understand their purpose and usage
2. Verified that the top-level `backend/` directory was not used in the application
3. Ensured that all necessary code was already in the `netraven/web/` directory 
4. Removed the redundant and unused top-level `backend/` directory

### Impact
- Simplified directory structure
- Removed potential confusion for developers
- Ensured all backend code follows the established package structure

## Scripts Directory Organization

### Issue
The `scripts/` directory contained a mixture of:
- Operational scripts needed for deployment and maintenance
- Database management scripts
- Test scripts that should be in the test directory
- Temporary or one-off scripts

This made it difficult to identify which scripts were essential versus temporary or for testing only.

### Analysis
We identified several categories of scripts:
- Database-related scripts for schema management and backups
- Maintenance scripts for system operations
- Deployment scripts for Docker and container setup
- Test scripts that should be separate from operational code
- Potentially obsolete or one-off scripts

### Changes Made
1. Created a logical directory structure to organize scripts by purpose:
   - `scripts/db/` - Database-related scripts
   - `scripts/maintenance/` - System maintenance scripts
   - `scripts/deployment/` - Docker and deployment-related scripts
   - `scripts/tests/` - Test scripts separate from the main test suite
   - `scripts/archive/` - Potentially obsolete scripts for future review
2. Moved scripts to appropriate directories without modifying their content
3. Ensured all scripts remained executable and functional

### Impact
- Better organization of scripts by purpose
- Clearer distinction between operational and test scripts
- Preserved all scripts for reference while improving organization
- Made it easier to identify essential scripts for system operation

## Next Steps
- Continue with other directory structure cleanup tasks
- Ensure all tests pass with the simplified directory structure
