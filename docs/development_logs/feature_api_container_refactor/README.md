## Project Coding Principles

For this refactoring project, we adhere to the following principles:

1. **Asynchronous First**: Design all services to work asynchronously, leveraging FastAPI's async capabilities
2. **Service Boundaries**: Establish clear service boundaries with well-defined interfaces
3. **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for service instantiation and configuration
4. **Authorization as Decorators**: Implement authorization checks as decorators for consistent enforcement
5. **Standardized Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling and logging across all components
6. **Testing**: Maintain high test coverage with unit and integration tests

## Implementation Log

### Phase 1: Core Service Factory (Completed April 2, 2023)

Phase 1 focused on establishing the service factory pattern to manage service instantiation and dependencies.

**Key Actions:**
- Created the `ServiceFactory` class with lazy loading of services
- Implemented service registration and retrieval mechanisms
- Added dependency injection support in FastAPI routes
- Updated service initialization to support both synchronous and asynchronous patterns
- Set up configuration management for services

**Outcome:**
- Services now follow a consistent instantiation pattern
- Routes can request services via dependency injection
- Services can be easily mocked for testing
- Configuration is centralized and type-checked

### Phase 2: Services and Routers (Completed April 3, 2023)

Phase 2 focused on refactoring service implementations and their corresponding routers to use the new service factory.

**Key Actions:**
- Implemented `AsyncDeviceService` and updated the devices router
- Implemented `AsyncCredentialsService` and updated the credentials router
- Implemented `AsyncTagService` and updated the tags router
- Implemented `AsyncUserService` and updated the users router
- Implemented `AsyncJobLogsService` and updated the job_logs router
- Added comprehensive logging and error handling

**Outcome:**
- All major services now follow the new asynchronous pattern
- Routers delegate business logic to services
- Improved error handling and logging across all components
- Better separation of concerns between routes and business logic

### Phase 3: Service Integration Architecture (Completed April 4, 2023)

Phase 3 focused on establishing a consistent architecture for service integration, particularly for credential management and job logs. The goal was to establish service boundaries and client interfaces for services like Device Gateway and Scheduler.

**Key Actions:**
- Refactored credential management using the service-oriented approach
- Established service boundaries for core components
- Created client interfaces for Device Gateway service
- Created client interfaces for Scheduler service
- Implemented job log management using the new service architecture
- Updated router endpoints to use the new service interfaces

**Outcome:**
- Clear separation of responsibilities between services
- Standardized interfaces for service interaction
- Improved testability through better service boundaries
- More maintainable code structure for future enhancements

### Phase 4: Authentication and Authorization (Completed [Date])

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization with proper token management and rate limiting.

**Developer Note (Continuation)**: This phase was picked up after initial work applying permission decorators.

**Key Actions (Completed in this session):**
- **Enhanced Rate Limiter:**
  - Created `netraven/web/auth/rate_limiting.py` with `AsyncRateLimiter` class.
  - Implemented TTL-based cleanup, size limits, IP+identifier tracking, and progressive backoff.
  - Integrated cleanup task into app startup/shutdown (`netraven/web/main.py`).
  - Applied rate limiting via `rate_limit_dependency` to `/auth/login` and `/auth/refresh` endpoints.
  - **Insight:** Discovered `/users/reset-password` endpoint mentioned in plan did not exist; skipped applying rate limit there.
- **Token Validation Middleware:**
  - Created `netraven/web/middleware/token_validation.py`.
  - Implemented middleware to centralize JWT validation (Bearer header/cookie) using `AsyncAuthService`.
  - Attaches validated `UserPrincipal` to `request.state.principal`.
  - Added middleware to the application stack (`netraven/web/main.py`).
- **Refactored Auth Dependencies:**
  - Updated `get_current_principal` and `optional_auth` in `netraven/web/auth/__init__.py`.
  - These dependencies now retrieve the principal from `request.state`, removing redundant token validation logic within them.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Added tests to `tests/integration/test_auth_advanced.py` covering token lifecycle: login, validation (valid/invalid/expired), refresh, revocation/logout.
  - Used `httpx.AsyncClient` for async testing.
- **API Documentation:**
  - Verified that FastAPI's auto-generated OpenAPI docs should correctly reflect Bearer authentication due to the use of `get_current_principal` dependency. No explicit documentation code changes made.

**Outcomes:**
- Centralized and robust token validation via middleware.
- Enhanced, albeit in-memory, rate limiting applied to key auth endpoints.
- Simplified auth dependencies in routes.
- Improved test coverage for core authentication flows.

### Phase 5: Error Handling and Validation (Completed [Date])

**Objective**: Implement standardized error handling, validation, and logging across the API.

**Key Actions:**
- **Refactored `AuditService`:**
  - Renamed and refactored `netraven/web/services/audit_service.py` to `AsyncAuditService`.
  - Converted methods to `async`, used `AsyncSession`, and updated DB queries (using `select`).
  - Integrated `AsyncAuditService` into the `ServiceFactory` (`netraven/core/services/service_factory.py`), making it injectable.
- **Standardized Error Schema:**
  - Created `netraven/web/schemas/errors.py` defining `StandardErrorResponse` and `FieldValidationError` Pydantic models.
- **Global Error Handling Middleware:**
  - Created `netraven/web/middleware/error_handling.py` with `GlobalErrorHandlingMiddleware`.
  - Catches `RequestValidationError`, `HTTPException`, and generic `Exception`.
  - Formats errors using `StandardErrorResponse` schema.
  - Performs standardized logging based on error type.
  - Added middleware to the application stack (`netraven/web/main.py`).

**Outcomes:**
- Consistent, structured error responses across the entire API.
- Centralized handling and logging of application exceptions.
- `AuditService` is now asynchronous and properly integrated with the service layer.
- Improved maintainability and debugging through standardized error handling.

### Phase 6: Asynchronous Operation (Completed [Date])

**Objective**: Ensure the entire API container operates asynchronously wherever I/O is involved.

**Key Actions:**
- **Verified Async Operations:** Reviewed services (`AsyncAuthService`, `AsyncTokenStore`, etc.) and routers to confirm usage of `async/await` and `AsyncSession` for database operations.
- **Refactored `authenticate_user`:** Converted the core `authenticate_user` function (`netraven/web/auth/__init__.py`) to be asynchronous, use `AsyncSession`, and call async CRUD helpers.
- **Refactored User CRUD:** Converted user CRUD functions (`netraven/web/crud/user.py`) to be asynchronous.
- **Updated `AsyncAuthService`:** Removed `asyncio.to_thread` wrapper previously used for `authenticate_user`.
- **Removed Redis Dependency:** Based on clarification that Redis is not currently used, refactored `AsyncTokenStore` (`netraven/core/services/token/async_token_store.py`) to remove all Redis-related code, imports, configuration checks, and fallback logic, leaving only the in-memory implementation.
  - **Decision Justification:** Simplifies the codebase, removes potential confusion for future developers, and avoids maintaining unused optional code paths, aligning with the principle of simple solutions.

**Outcomes:**
- Core authentication flow is now fully asynchronous.
- `AsyncTokenStore` is simplified and solely uses in-memory storage, reflecting the current project requirements.
- Increased confidence that I/O operations within the API container are non-blocking.

### Phase 7: API Documentation and Testing (Completed [Date])

**Objective**: Enhance API documentation and testing coverage.

**Key Actions:**
- **OpenAPI Documentation:**
  - Enhanced OpenAPI definitions for `/auth` and `/devices` endpoints (as examples) by adding summaries, descriptions, response descriptions, and standardized error responses (`StandardErrorResponse`).
  - Added descriptions to path parameters.
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Added unit tests for `GlobalErrorHandlingMiddleware` (`tests/unit/middleware/test_error_handling.py`) covering various exception types.
- **Integration/System Testing:**
  - Added async fixtures (`async_client`, `test_user`, `logged_in_client`) to `tests/integration/test_system_functionality.py`.
  - Added a basic system workflow test (`test_basic_user_workflow`) covering login, resource access (success/fail), and logout.

**Outcomes:**
- Improved clarity and usability of the auto-generated API documentation.
- Increased test coverage for error handling and core authentication flows.
- Established a foundation for further system workflow tests.

### Phase 8: Containerization and Configuration Enhancement (Completed [Date])

**Objective**: Improve Docker configuration, security, and efficiency.

**Key Actions:**
- **Optimized Dockerfile (`docker/Dockerfile.api`):**
  - Refactored to use a multi-stage build to reduce final image size.
  - Updated `COPY` instructions to be more specific, improving layer caching.
  - Ensured proper non-root user setup (`netraven`).
  - Switched default `CMD` to use `gunicorn` with `uvicorn` workers.
- **Improved Health Check:**
  - Enhanced the `/health` endpoint (`netraven/web/main.py`) to perform a database connectivity check.
  - Configured the Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK` instruction to use the improved endpoint.
- **Verified Volumes & Config:**
  - Reviewed `docker-compose.yml`.
  - Confirmed persistent data/config volumes are correctly defined.
  - **Recommendation:** Highlighted that development-specific source code volume mounts (`../netraven:/app/netraven`, etc.) **must be removed** from the compose file used for production deployment.

**Outcomes:**
- More optimized and potentially smaller Docker image for the API service.
- More reliable container health checking including database connectivity.
- Clearer separation between development and production container configuration needs regarding volume mounts.

## Next Steps (Post-Refactor)

With the completion of the 8 planned refactoring phases for the API container, the following steps are recommended:

1.  **Thorough Testing:**
    *   Execute the complete test suite (`pytest tests/` or similar command) within the containerized environment (`docker-compose up --build -d test_db api ...`).
    *   Pay close attention to integration tests (`tests/integration/`) and the new system workflow tests (`tests/integration/test_system_functionality.py`).
    *   Identify and fix any regressions or failing tests.

2.  **Code Review:**
    *   Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub for the `feature/api-container-refactor` branch, targeting the appropriate integration branch (e.g., `develop`).
    *   Clearly summarize the changes and link to this development log in the PR description.
    *   Assign reviewers to examine the code for adherence to principles, architectural alignment, correctness, and potential issues.

3.  **Address Feedback:**
    *   Collaborate with reviewers and incorporate any feedback provided on the PR.
    *   Ensure all discussions are resolved and necessary changes are committed to the feature branch.

4.  **Merge:**
    *   Once the PR is approved and all automated checks (CI/CD pipelines, tests) pass, merge the `feature/api-container-refactor` branch into the target integration branch.

5.  **Future Work Planning:**
    *   Review the technical debt documentation created during the refactor (e.g., `rate_limiting_tech_debt.md`).
    *   Search the codebase for any remaining `TODO` comments added during the refactoring.
    *   Create new issues or tasks in the project management system to address identified technical debt (like persistent rate limiting) and other potential enhancements.
    *   Consider the next container or area designated for refactoring according to the overall project plan.
