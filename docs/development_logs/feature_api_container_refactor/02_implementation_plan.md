# API Container Refactoring: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for refactoring the API container to align with the intended architecture as specified in the source of truth documentation. The plan is organized into phases, with each phase focusing on specific aspects of the refactoring effort.

## Implementation Principles

All implementation work will adhere to the following principles:

1. **Incremental Changes**: Changes will be made incrementally to ensure stability throughout the refactoring process.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility wherever possible to minimize disruption.
3. **Test-Driven Approach**: Use tests to validate changes and ensure functionality is preserved.
4. **Documentation**: Document all significant changes, decisions, and rationales.
5. **Code Review**: All changes will be subject to code review before final integration.

## Phased Implementation

The refactoring will be implemented in the following phases:

## Dependencies and Order of Implementation

The phases should be implemented in the order presented, as each phase builds upon the changes made in previous phases. However, there are specific dependencies to consider:

- Phase 1 (Core API Structure) must be completed before any other phases
- Phase 2 (Service Layer Refactoring) is a prerequisite for Phase 3 (Service Integration)
- Phase 4 (Authentication) and Phase 5 (Error Handling) can be implemented in parallel after Phase 2
- Phase 6 (Asynchronous Operation) depends on the completion of Phase 2 and Phase 5
- Phase 7 (Documentation and Testing) should be implemented incrementally throughout other phases
- Phase 8 (Containerization) can be implemented independently of other phases

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

The following risks have been identified for this refactoring effort:

1. **Regression Risk**: Changes could introduce regressions in existing functionality.
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive test coverage and incremental changes.

2. **Integration Risk**: Changes to service boundaries could affect integration with other services.
   - *Mitigation*: Clear interface definitions and integration tests.

3. **Performance Risk**: Changes to async patterns could affect performance.
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing before and after changes.

4. **Scope Creep**: Refactoring could expand beyond the defined scope.
   - *Mitigation*: Strict adherence to the implementation plan and regular reviews.

## Testing Strategy

The refactoring will be accompanied by a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **System Tests**: Test complete API workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Validate performance characteristics

All tests will be executed in the Docker-based environment that matches the deployment environment to ensure consistency.

## Acceptance Criteria

The refactoring will be considered complete when the following criteria are met:

1. All identified gaps between current and intended architecture have been addressed
2. All functionality present in the original implementation is preserved
3. Test coverage meets or exceeds the requirements
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. Container configuration meets all security and performance requirements
