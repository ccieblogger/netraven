# Rate Limiting Technical Debt

## Current Implementation

The NetRaven API currently implements a simple in-memory rate limiting solution that:
- Tracks failed login attempts in memory
- Uses a basic counter-based approach
- Lacks persistence across application restarts
- Does not support distributed deployments

## Limitations

1. **Lack of Persistence**
   - Rate limiting state is lost on application restart
   - Potential for security bypass through forced restarts

2. **Scalability Issues**
   - Does not work effectively in multi-instance deployments
   - Each instance maintains its own separate rate limiting state
   - No synchronization between instances

3. **Memory Management**
   - Potential for memory leaks if counters aren't properly cleaned up
   - No enforced limits on the size of the in-memory store
   - Risk of denial-of-service through memory exhaustion

4. **Limited Scope**
   - Currently only applied to authentication endpoints
   - No rate limiting for other potentially expensive operations
   - Limited configurability of thresholds and windows

## Enhancement Requirements

A production-grade rate limiting solution for NetRaven should provide:

1. **Persistence**
   - State should survive application restarts
   - Historical rate limiting data should be preserved

2. **Distributed Support**
   - Synchronized state across multiple API instances
   - Consistent enforcement in clustered environments

3. **Configurability**
   - Different limits for different endpoint types
   - Adjustable time windows and thresholds
   - IP-based, user-based, and endpoint-based limiting

4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Integration with monitoring systems
   - Alerts for potential attacks
   - Historical metrics for security analysis

5. **Performance**
   - Minimal impact on response times
   - Efficient storage and lookup
   - Proper cleanup of expired data

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Database-Backed Solution

**Implementation Approach:**
- Store rate limiting data in the main application database
- Create tables for tracking attempts by IP, user, and endpoint
- Implement automatic cleanup for expired records
- Use database transactions for consistent updates

**Advantages:**
- Leverages existing database infrastructure
- Consistent with other persistence in the application
- Familiar technology for the development team

**Disadvantages:**
- Additional load on the main database
- Potential performance impact for high-traffic deployments
- More complex queries for distributed scenarios

### Option 2: Redis-Backed Solution

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Redis for rate limiting data storage
- Implement sliding window counters using Redis sorted sets
- Leverage Redis expiration for automatic cleanup
- Use Lua scripts for atomic operations

**Advantages:**
- Better performance than database solution
- Built-in expiration mechanisms
- Better suited for high-throughput scenarios

**Disadvantages:**
- Introduces additional infrastructure dependency
- Requires Redis expertise for maintenance
- Need for fallback mechanisms if Redis is unavailable

## Recommended Path Forward

1. **Short-Term (Current Refactoring)**
   - Enhance the existing in-memory solution:
     - Improve counter management
     - Add proper cleanup of expired records
     - Implement better thread safety
     - Add basic monitoring

2. **Mid-Term (Next Quarter)**
   - Implement a separate rate limiting service that:
     - Uses the database for persistence
     - Provides a clear API for rate limit checks
     - Supports distributed deployments
     - Includes monitoring and alerting

3. **Long-Term (Future Architecture)**
   - Consider a dedicated Redis instance for rate limiting
   - Implement a more sophisticated algorithm (token bucket or sliding window)
   - Add ML-based anomaly detection for adaptive rate limiting
   - Develop centralized monitoring and reporting

## Migration Strategy

1. **Design Phase**
   - Create detailed requirements
   - Design database schema or Redis data structures
   - Define service interfaces

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Develop the new rate limiting service
   - Implement database persistence or Redis integration
   - Add comprehensive test coverage

3. **Transition Phase**
   - Deploy in shadow mode alongside existing implementation
   - Gradually shift traffic to new implementation
   - Monitor for any issues or performance impacts

4. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove old in-memory implementation
   - Update documentation
   - Train team on new implementation

## Conclusion

The current in-memory rate limiting implementation provides basic protection but falls short for production-grade security in a distributed environment. A proper persistent solution, ideally database-backed to align with existing architecture, should be implemented as a dedicated effort. This enhancement will require careful design and implementation but will significantly improve the security posture of the NetRaven API.
