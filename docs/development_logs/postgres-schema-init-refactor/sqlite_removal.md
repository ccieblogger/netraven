# SQLite References Removal

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to remove SQLite references from the NetRaven codebase, ensuring that PostgreSQL is the only supported database as specified in the architecture requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files
- Updated `config/web/database.yaml` to remove SQLite and MySQL configuration sections
- Updated `config/netraven.yaml.example` to use PostgreSQL as the default database type
- Ensured all example configurations consistently reference PostgreSQL

### 2. Test Files
- Updated `tests/utils/db_init.py` to use PostgreSQL for tests instead of SQLite
- Updated `tests/unit/test_credential_store.py` to use PostgreSQL for unit tests
- Removed in-memory SQLite references from credential store tests

### 3. Credential Store
- Enhanced `netraven.core.credential_store.create_credential_store()` to always use PostgreSQL
- Added proper PostgreSQL URL construction from configuration
- Improved error handling to make PostgreSQL requirements clear

### 4. Dependencies
- Removed `aiosqlite` dependency from `docker/requirements.txt`
- Removed `aiomysql` dependency from `docker/requirements.txt`
- Updated database section in requirements to explicitly state "PostgreSQL only"

## Validation Approach
The changes were made with careful attention to:

1. **Consistency**: Ensuring all configuration files and code consistently reference PostgreSQL
2. **Testing**: Updating test files to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
3. **Documentation**: Adding clear comments explaining the PostgreSQL-only requirement
4. **Error Handling**: Improving error messages when non-PostgreSQL configurations are detected

## Alignment with Project Principles

### Code Quality and Maintainability
- **Simple Solutions**: Provided straightforward PostgreSQL connection handling
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Reused existing database connection patterns
- **Refactor Large Files**: Kept changes focused and minimal

### Change Management
- **Scope of Changes**: Made only necessary changes to remove SQLite references
- **Introduce New Patterns Cautiously**: Maintained existing patterns while enforcing PostgreSQL

### Testing Practices
- Updated test environments to use PostgreSQL as per the architecture requirements
- Ensured tests reflect the production environment by using the same database type

## Next Steps
With SQLite references removed from the codebase, we should now:

1. Fix any remaining dependency issues
2. Run comprehensive tests to ensure all components work properly with PostgreSQL
3. Update any documentation that might still reference SQLite
4. Ensure error messages provide clear guidance when database connection issues occur
