# API Container Startup Fix

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix issues with the API container failing to start in a healthy state as part of the PostgreSQL schema initialization refactoring.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Schema Initialization Script
- Added comprehensive database connectivity checks to `scripts/initialize_schema.py`
- Improved error handling with detailed error messages and full stack traces
- Added a `check_database_setup()` function to diagnose database configuration issues
- Enhanced schema validation to properly handle missing tables
- Added better reporting of table structure for debugging

### 2. Updated Entrypoint Script
- Enhanced `docker/entrypoint.sh` to perform proper environment variable validation
- Added explicit checks for required PostgreSQL environment variables
- Improved error handling with appropriate exit codes
- Added preliminary database connection check before initialization
- Set environment variable to indicate container execution
- Ensured proper `SERVICE_TYPE` environment variable is passed

### 3. Added Database Check Utility
- Enhanced `scripts/db_check.py` to support PostgreSQL-only validation
- Added `--postgres-only` flag to enforce PostgreSQL-only configuration
- Added `--check-tables` flag to validate required tables exist
- Created `verify_postgres_only()` function for database type validation
- Added `check_required_tables()` function to validate schema integrity

### 4. Updated Docker Configuration
- Fixed `docker-compose.yml` to properly set required environment variables
- Set appropriate `SERVICE_TYPE` environment variables for each service
- Updated healthcheck configuration with proper start periods
- Simplified entrypoint commands for better readability
- Ensured proper container dependencies and startup sequence

## Validation Methodology
The changes were carefully constructed to ensure that:

1. The initialization script properly handles connection issues with appropriate retry logic
2. The database type is strictly enforced as PostgreSQL
3. The initialization process provides clear error messages for troubleshooting
4. The Docker container startup process follows proper initialization sequence
5. Health checks have appropriate startup periods to allow for initialization

## Next Steps
With the API container startup issues fixed, we should now:

1. Complete the removal of SQLite references from the codebase
2. Fix any remaining dependency issues
3. Update configuration files to standardize on PostgreSQL
4. Update test files to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite

## Alignment with Project Principles

### Code Quality and Maintainability
- **Simple Solutions**: Enhanced error handling without adding unnecessary complexity
- **No Code Duplication**: Reused existing patterns for database connectivity
- **File Organization**: Maintained clear script organization with proper logging

### Change Management
- **Scope of Changes**: Made only necessary changes to fix the startup issues
- **Introduced New Patterns Cautiously**: Enhanced existing scripts without changing fundamental design

### Testing Practices
- Added more comprehensive validation of database setup
- Improved error reporting to facilitate testing and debugging
