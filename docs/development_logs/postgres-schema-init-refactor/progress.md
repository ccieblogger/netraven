# PostgreSQL Schema Initialization Refactoring - Development Log

## Implementation Plan

### Overview
This implementation plan outlines a phased approach to refactor the PostgreSQL schema initialization process to follow a hybrid approach using SQL scripts for database-level operations and SQLAlchemy models for table definitions.

### Phases Summary
1. **Analysis & Preparation**: Create feature branch, analyze current schema, prepare documentation
2. **Base Class Consolidation**: Consolidate SQLAlchemy Base classes into a single source of truth
3. **Schema Initialization Script**: Refactor initialization process
4. **Docker Configuration Update**: Update container startup sequence
5. **Backup Volume Implementation**: Add backup functionality
6. **Documentation Update**: Update existing documentation
7. **Testing & Verification**: Comprehensive testing
8. **Integration**: Merge into integration branch, final testing

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Analysis & Preparation
**Estimated time**: 1 day
**Tasks**:
- Create feature branch `feature/postgres-schema-init-refactor` from main branch
- Create development log at `docs/development_logs/postgres-schema-init-refactor/progress.md`
- Analyze all existing model files to identify all SQLAlchemy model definitions
- Audit all files that import the Base class from both locations
- Create a comprehensive list of all tables currently defined
- Create a mapping document showing the transition plan

#### Phase 2: Base Class Consolidation
**Estimated time**: 2 days
**Tasks**:
- Modify credential store models to use the Base class from `netraven.web.database`
- Update all imports to use the unified Base class
- Create unit tests to verify model integrity
- Update model relationships affected by the consolidation
- Verify database schema integrity

#### Phase 3: Dependency Fixes - Completed âœ…

Phase 3 focused on ensuring all PostgreSQL dependencies are correctly installed and configured:

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- **Phase**: 9 - Integration
- **Progress**: 25%
- **Current Focus**: Integration branch created, preparing for full test suite run 
- **Next Steps**: Run full test suite on integration branch, address any issues found

### Phase 1: Analysis & Preparation
- [2025-04-02] Created feature branch `feature/postgres-schema-init-refactor`
- [2025-04-02] Created development log at `docs/development_logs/postgres-schema-init-refactor/progress.md`
- [2025-04-02] Completed initial analysis of model files and Base class usage
- [2025-04-02] Created comprehensive table mapping at `docs/development_logs/postgres-schema-init-refactor/table_mapping.md`
- [2025-04-02] âœ… Phase 1 Complete

#### Base Class Usage Analysis
1. **Main Base Class (netraven.web.database.Base)**:
   - Located in: `netraven/web/database.py`
   - Used by the following models:
     - `netraven/web/models/user.py`: User model
     - `netraven/web/models/device.py`: Device model
     - `netraven/web/models/backup.py`: Backup model
     - `netraven/web/models/tag.py`: Tag and TagRule models
     - `netraven/web/models/job_log.py`: JobLog and JobLogEntry models
     - `netraven/web/models/scheduled_job.py`: ScheduledJob model
     - `netraven/web/models/admin_settings.py`: AdminSetting model
     - `netraven/web/models/audit_log.py`: AuditLog model
     - `netraven/web/models/auth.py`: Auth-related models

2. **Secondary Base Class (netraven.core.credential_store.Base)**:
   - Located in: `netraven/core/credential_store.py`
   - Used by the following models:
     - `Credential`: Stores device credentials
     - `CredentialTag`: Links credentials with tags

#### Current Schema Initialization Process
1. **PostgreSQL Container Initialization**:
   - Uses `postgres:14-alpine` as the base image
   - Runs `scripts/init-db.sql` on container startup, which:
     - Creates required PostgreSQL extensions
     - Creates the `netraven` schema
     - Sets the search path
   - Does not create any tables

2. **Table Creation**:
   - Tables are created by SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` at runtime
   - Called from `scripts/ensure_schema.py`, which:
     - Runs the `init_db()` function from `netraven.web.database`
     - Performs runtime schema modifications for specific columns
     - This script is executed at container startup: `python /app/scripts/ensure_schema.py && /app/docker/entrypoint.sh`

3. **Dual Base Classes Issue**:
   - Two separate Base classes mean two separate metadata collections
   - Tables defined under the credential_store Base aren't created by the web.database initialization
   - This likely requires separate initialization calls

#### Database Persistence
1. **Current Volume Configuration**:
   - Named volume for PostgreSQL data: `postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/`
   - No dedicated backup volume as specified in the source of truth

#### Issues Identified
1. **Multiple Base Classes**: Using two separate Base classes can lead to inconsistent schema initialization
2. **Runtime Schema Modifications**: The ensure_schema.py script modifies schema at runtime
3. **Missing Backup Volume**: No dedicated backup volume for database backups
4. **Initialization Complexity**: The process involves both SQL scripts and Python code

## Challenges and Issues

During testing, we've identified several challenges and issues:

- **API Container Health**: The API container is listed as unhealthy due to issues with its startup and binding to the expected port
- **Architecture Deviation**: We've identified significant architectural discrepancies between the current implementation and the intended architecture documented in the source of truth
- **Role Separation**: The API container has device interaction capabilities that should be exclusive to the Device Gateway
- **NetMiko Integration**: The API container is initializing NetMiko logs and device connector functionality

These architectural issues are documented in detail in the integration summary and will need to be addressed in a future refactoring effort.

## Next Steps

1. Merge the completed PostgreSQL migration work into the develop branch
2. Document the architectural issues for future resolution
3. Create a new refactoring project to address the API container architecture issues

## Issues Encountered
- Testing in Docker environment requires complete Docker setup with all Dockerfiles in place
- Tests were designed to run in the Docker environment according to testing methodology, but local development environment lacks complete Docker setup

## Insights & Recommendations
- Moving model definitions to a proper package structure improves code organization
- The credential_tags relationship now properly references the tags table
- The consolidated approach simplifies schema initialization
- Database connection retry logic is essential for container environments
- Comprehensive testing is critical for ensuring the schema initialization process works correctly in all environments

## Handoff Notes
- Phases 1-6 complete
- Phase 7 (Testing & Verification) nearly complete
- Run the integration tests with `pytest tests/integration/ -v` to verify the changes
- For Docker tests, set the RUN_DOCKER_TESTS environment variable and ensure Docker is running
- Phase 8 (Integration) will involve creating an integration branch and merging the feature branch
