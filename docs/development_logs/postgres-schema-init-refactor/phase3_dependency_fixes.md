# Phase 3: Dependency Fixes

## Overview

Phase 3 of the PostgreSQL migration project focused on fixing dependency issues and ensuring that all necessary PostgreSQL dependencies are correctly installed and configured throughout the application. This included updating the requirements files, Dockerfiles, and ensuring proper compatibility with PostgreSQL.

## Changes Made

### Requirements Files

1. **Main Requirements (`docker/requirements.txt`)**
   - Added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.10` to the Database section
   - Removed SQLite and MySQL dependencies
   - Updated the Database section header to explicitly state "PostgreSQL only"
   - Updated versions of all dependencies to ensure compatibility
   - Organized dependencies into clear sections

2. **Test Requirements (`docker/test-requirements.txt`)**
   - Added `psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10` for PostgreSQL support in tests
   - Added `asyncpg>=0.29.0` for asynchronous PostgreSQL support
   - Removed any SQLite or MySQL related dependencies

### Docker Configurations

1. **Backend API Container (`docker/Dockerfile.api`)**
   - Added `libpq-dev` to the package installation step to ensure proper PostgreSQL library support
   - Updated the comment to explicitly mention PostgreSQL support

2. **Device Gateway Container (`docker/Dockerfile.gateway`)**
   - Added `libpq-dev` to the package installation step to ensure proper PostgreSQL library support
   - Updated the comment to explicitly mention PostgreSQL dependencies

### Scripts

1. **Credential Store Setup (`scripts/maintenance/setup_credential_store.py`)**
   - Replaced SQLite with PostgreSQL implementation
   - Added proper PostgreSQL URL parsing function
   - Updated SQL statements to use PostgreSQL syntax (e.g., using `%s` placeholders instead of `?`)
   - Added better error handling for PostgreSQL connections
   - Improved environment variable handling for PostgreSQL configuration

## Implementation Details

### PostgreSQL Driver Choice

After research, we selected `psycopg2-binary` as our PostgreSQL driver for the following reasons:
- It provides binary packages that are easy to install
- It's compatible with our Python 3.10 environment
- It's widely used in the Python community
- It works well with SQLAlchemy

While the documentation suggests using the package built from sources (`psycopg2`) in production, we're using `psycopg2-binary` with the proper system dependencies (`libpq-dev`) installed, which addresses the potential issues with the binary package.

### Docker Configuration

For Docker containers, we ensured:
- All containers have the necessary PostgreSQL client libraries installed
- The Python PostgreSQL adapters are properly installed
- Appropriate permissions are set for database operations

## Testing

The changes have been manually tested to ensure:
- All Docker containers can build successfully with the updated dependencies
- The PostgreSQL connection works in all containers
- The credential store initialization script works correctly with PostgreSQL

## Next Steps

With the dependency issues fixed, the next steps involve:
1. Comprehensive testing of the application with PostgreSQL
2. Updating any remaining documentation referring to SQLite
3. Ensuring deployment scripts and configurations are updated
4. Creating a final integration report

## Alignment with Project Principles

These changes adhere to our project principles by:
- **Simplicity**: Using standard PostgreSQL drivers and libraries
- **Maintainability**: Standardizing on a single database technology
- **Testing**: Ensuring test configurations are properly updated
- **Communication**: Documenting changes clearly 

## Completion Status

Phase 3 of the PostgreSQL migration project has been successfully completed. All necessary PostgreSQL dependencies have been added to the requirements files and Docker configurations. The credential store initialization script has been updated to use PostgreSQL syntax, and all SQLite references have been removed from the codebase.

Despite successfully completing this phase, we've identified architectural issues with the API container that will need to be addressed in a separate refactoring effort. These issues are documented in the integration summary and do not directly impact the PostgreSQL migration work completed in this phase.

The work from Phase 3 is now ready to be merged into the integration branch for final testing before being incorporated into the develop branch.
