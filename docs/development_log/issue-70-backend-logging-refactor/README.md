# Development Log: Issue #70 - Backend Logging Refactor (Unified Log Table)

## Overview
This log tracks the refactor of all backend logging to use the unified log table schema, as required by [issue #70](https://github.com/ccieblogger/netraven/issues/70). The goal is to ensure all logging is routed through the new unified logger and persisted with correct metadata, removing all legacy log writing and models.

---

## Phases & Key Changes

### Phase 1: UnifiedLogger & DB Log Writing Refactor
- Updated `UnifiedLogger` to remove all references to `job_type_id` and legacy fields.
- Refactored `save_log` to match the new schema.
- Confirmed the `Log` model is correct and up to date.

### Phase 2: Remove Legacy Log Writing
- Removed all usage of `save_job_log` and any legacy log writing in the codebase.
- Migrated all job/device log writing to use `logger.log` with correct metadata.
- Confirmed no references to deprecated log models remain.

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation
- Updated `test_unified_logger.py` to mock `save_log` and verify correct arguments for the unified schema.
- Confirmed all logger tests use the new interface and do not reference removed fields.
- (Pending) Update developer and API documentation for new logging usage and schema.

### Phase 4: Real-Time Log Streaming & Nginx SSE Proxy
- Implemented `/logs/stream` SSE endpoint in FastAPI with 15s keep-alive heartbeat.
- Updated Nginx config to add a dedicated `location /api/logs/stream` block with all required SSE proxy settings (buffering off, X-Accel-Buffering, etc.).
- Fixed proxy path so `/api/logs/stream` is mapped to `/logs/stream` on the backend.
- Verified streaming works through Nginx with correct headers and persistent connection.
- Noted that trailing slash requests (`/api/logs/stream/`) result in a 307 redirect (expected FastAPI behavior).

## Insights & Notes
- All logging is now routed through the unified logger and persisted to the unified log table.
- No legacy log writing or deprecated log models remain in the codebase.
- All log calls include appropriate metadata: `log_type`, `level`, `job_id`, `device_id`, `source`, and `meta`.
- The codebase is now fully aligned with the unified logging architecture.

## Next Steps (as of 2025-04-25)
- Integrate frontend or consumer to display real-time logs.
- Monitor for edge cases (proxy disconnects, client reconnects).
- Finalize developer/API documentation for SSE usage and Nginx requirements.
- (Optional) Add tests for SSE endpoint and Nginx proxy behavior.
