# Phase 2: Frontend Enhancements â€” Development Log

## Summary

**Issue:** [#48 - Complete System Job & Worker Integration (UI, Tag Association, Status Handling)](https://github.com/ccieblogger/netraven/issues/48)

### Changes Implemented
- Refactored `JobFormModal.vue` to support targeting either a single device or a group of devices by tags:
  - Added a radio/toggle for "Target a single device" vs. "Target by tags".
  - Added a device dropdown (populated from the device store) for single-device selection.
  - Show/hide the tag selector or device dropdown based on user choice.
  - Updated form validation to require either a device or at least one tag, but not both.
  - Updated the submit logic to send only one of `device_id` or `tag_ids` in the payload.
  - Added help text/tooltips for clarity.
- Ensured device and tag data are fetched when the modal opens.
- No changes required to the main jobs page or device store logic.

### Rationale
- Aligns with requirements: jobs can target a single device or a group of devices (by tags), but not both.
- UI/UX is clear and prevents invalid combinations.
- Code is simple, maintainable, and avoids duplication.

### Insights
- No reusable device selector component existed; a simple dropdown was implemented directly in the modal.
- The device and tag stores already provide the necessary data and fetch methods.
- The modal logic is now ready for backend support of the new API contract (Phase 3).

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 3: Backend/API Enhancement.
  - Update the job creation API to accept `device_id` or `tag_ids` (mutually exclusive).
  - Update job execution logic to support both targeting modes.
  - Add/extend tests for both flows.
- After backend changes, test the full job creation and execution flow from the UI.
