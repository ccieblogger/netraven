# Development Log: Issue #29 - Missing Add Tag Modal

## Phase 4: Final Fix - Robust Edit Modal Population

**Date:** [auto-fill on commit]
**Branch:** issue/29-missing-add-tag-modal

### Summary
- Refactored `TagFormModal.vue` to ensure the form is always populated with tag data when editing.
- Removed the watcher on `props.isOpen` and the `resetForm` function.
- Added a watcher on `props.tagToEdit` (with `{ immediate: true }`) and used `onMounted` to always set the form from `tagToEdit`.
- This ensures the modal works reliably for both add and edit flows, regardless of how/when the modal is opened.

### Verification
- Tested editing a tag and confirmed the fields are now always populated with the correct tag data.

---

**What and Why:**
- What: Refactored the modal to robustly handle form population for editing.
- Why: This resolves the persistent bug and ensures a reliable user experience for tag management.
