# Development Log: Issue #29 - Missing Add Tag Modal

## Phase 1: Modal Component Implementation

**Date:** [auto-fill on commit]
**Branch:** issue/29-missing-add-tag-modal

### Summary
- Implemented `TagFormModal.vue` in `frontend/src/components/` to provide a modal for adding and editing tags.
- The modal follows the established pattern from `DeviceFormModal.vue` and uses the shared `BaseModal` and `FormField` components.
- Supports both create and edit modes, with validation and error handling.
- Emits `save` and `close` events for parent integration.

### Key Decisions
- Reused modal and form patterns for UI/UX consistency and maintainability.
- Only included fields present in the tag model (name, type). Validation ensures name is required.
- Store integration and parent wiring will be handled in Phase 2.

### Next Steps
- Integrate the modal into `Tags.vue` and connect to the tag store for create/update actions.
- Replace placeholder logic in the tags page with real modal usage.

**What and Why:**
- What: Created a reusable modal component for tag creation/editing.
- Why: This is required to resolve the missing modal bug and provide a consistent, user-friendly tag management experience.
