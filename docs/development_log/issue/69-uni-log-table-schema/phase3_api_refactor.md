# Development Log: Phase 3 - Unified Logs API Refactor (Issue #69)

## Summary
Implemented the new unified logs API endpoints as designed, supporting advanced filtering, metadata, statistics, and real-time streaming (stub). Removed all legacy log routers and schemas. Updated main.py to register the new logs router.

## Rationale
- Provides a single, extensible API for all log types with robust filtering and metadata.
- Simplifies frontend integration and future-proofs the logging system.
- Removes technical debt from legacy log endpoints and schemas.

## Files Changed
- `netraven/api/routers/logs.py`: New unified logs API router and endpoints.
- `netraven/api/routers/job_logs.py`: Deleted (legacy).
- `netraven/api/routers/connection_logs.py`: Deleted (legacy).
- `netraven/api/main.py`: Registers new logs router, removes old ones.
- `netraven/api/schemas/log.py`: Cleaned up to only include unified log models and metadata/statistics.

## Test Updates
- Updated `tests/api/test_logs.py` to target the new unified logs API endpoints and model.
- Removed `tests/api/test_job_logs.py` (legacy job log tests).
- Rationale: Ensures all tests validate the new unified logging system and API, and removes technical debt from legacy endpoints.

## Next Steps
- Update worker, scheduler, and service logic to use the new logging utilities and API throughout.
- Update and expand tests for unified logging and API endpoints.
- Document API usage and update OpenAPI docs as needed.
