# Development Log: Phase 2 â€“ Real-Time Log Streaming Endpoint

## Date Started: 2024-06-08

## Objective
Implement a real-time log streaming endpoint for the NetRaven API using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Redis Pub/Sub, as required by Issue #72.

## Plan
- Design and implement the `/logs/stream` endpoint using SSE for real-time log delivery to clients.
- Integrate with Redis Pub/Sub so that log-producing workers publish new log events to a Redis channel.
- The API service subscribes to the Redis channel and pushes new log events to connected SSE clients.
- Support filtering in the stream (e.g., by job_id, device_id) via query parameters.
- Ensure authentication and security for the streaming endpoint.
- Add/expand tests for the streaming endpoint (connection, filtering, security).
- Update OpenAPI documentation and add usage docs for frontend/API consumers.

## Initial State
- The `/logs/stream` endpoint exists as a stub and does not provide real-time streaming.
- Redis is already used for RQ and is available in the environment.
- No backend logic for log event publishing or SSE streaming is implemented.
- No test coverage for log streaming.

## Progress Update (2024-06-08)
- Implemented the `/logs/stream` SSE endpoint in the API using `aioredis` for async Redis Pub/Sub.
- The endpoint subscribes to the configured Redis channel and streams log events to connected clients in real time.
- Supports optional filtering by `job_id` and `device_id` via query parameters.
- Authentication is enforced via router dependencies.
- Next: Add/expand tests for the streaming endpoint, update documentation, and commit changes.

## Next Steps
1. Design the backend architecture for log event publishing and streaming (SSE + Redis Pub/Sub).
2. Implement the Redis Pub/Sub integration and SSE endpoint.
3. Add filtering, authentication, and security logic.
4. Add/expand tests for the streaming endpoint.
5. Update documentation and commit changes.
