# Development Log: Phase 1 â€“ Add job_type Filtering to Log Query API

## Date Started: 2024-06-08

## Objective
Implement filtering of logs by `job_type` via the `/logs/` API endpoint, as required by Issue #72.

## Plan
- Update the `/logs/` endpoint to support filtering logs by the `job_type` of the related `Job`.
- Add `job_type` as an optional query parameter.
- Update OpenAPI documentation and API schema.
- Add/expand tests for log queries by `job_type`.

## Initial State
- The `/logs/` endpoint currently supports filtering by `job_id`, `device_id`, `log_type`, `level`, `source`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `search`.
- The `Log` model does not have a direct `job_type` field; it is present on the related `Job` model.
- No test coverage for log queries by `job_type`.

## Progress Update (2024-06-08)
- Implementation of job_type filtering is beginning.
- Will update the API endpoint, schema, and tests as described in the plan.

## Completion Update (2024-06-08)
- The job_type filter for the /logs/ API endpoint is implemented, tested, and committed.
- All log API tests, including the new job_type filter, are passing in the containerized environment.
- Unrelated test failures (users, tags, device credentials, etc.) are out of scope for this issue and should be addressed separately.

## Next Steps
1. Update the API endpoint and query logic to support filtering by `job_type`.
2. Update the API schema and OpenAPI docs.
3. Add/expand tests for the new filter.
4. Commit changes and update this log.
