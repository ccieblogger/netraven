# Development Log: Jobs Dashboard Enhancement (Issue #52)

## Summary
Enhance the jobs dashboard with new API endpoints for scheduled jobs, recent executions, job types, and system status. Fix persistent 422 errors in test suite.

---

## Problem
- New dashboard endpoints (`/jobs/scheduled`, `/jobs/recent`, etc.) returned 422 Unprocessable Entity errors during API tests.
- Error message: FastAPI tried to parse 'scheduled' as an integer for `/jobs/{job_id}`.

## Root Cause
- FastAPI route matching order: dynamic route `/jobs/{job_id}` was registered before static routes like `/jobs/scheduled`.
- Requests to `/jobs/scheduled` were incorrectly routed to `/jobs/{job_id}` with `job_id='scheduled'`, causing integer parsing errors.

## Solution
- Moved all static dashboard endpoints above the dynamic `/jobs/{job_id}` route in `netraven/api/routers/jobs.py`.
- FastAPI now matches static routes first, resolving the 422 errors.

## Test Results
- All 21 job API tests now pass.
- No 422 errors remain for dashboard endpoints.

## Insights
- FastAPI route order is critical when mixing static and dynamic path segments.
- Always register static routes before dynamic ones to avoid ambiguous matches.
- Print response bodies in tests to quickly diagnose validation errors.

## Next Steps
- Commit the fix (user will handle).
- Update GitHub issue with summary and resolution.
- Proceed to frontend integration for the jobs dashboard.
