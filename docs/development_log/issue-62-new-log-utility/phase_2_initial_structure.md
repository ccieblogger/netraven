# Phase 2: Initial Structure â€” Unified Logger Utility

## Date: 2025-04-24

### Summary
- Created `netraven/utils/unified_logger.py` as the foundation for the new unified, multi-destination logger utility.
- The logger is designed to support file (with rotation), stdout, Redis (real-time), and DB (wrapping existing log utilities).
- The initial structure includes:
  - Class skeleton with config-driven initialization
  - Stubs for all required destinations
  - Docstrings and TODOs for each section

### Next Steps
- Implement config parsing and destination setup in `UnifiedLogger`.
- Implement file and stdout logging handlers.
- Integrate Redis and DB logging.
- Add robust error handling and fallback logic.
- Provide a global logger instance for use across the codebase.

---

This log will be updated as development progresses on this feature branch.

---

## Update: Config Parsing and Destination Setup (2025-04-24)
- Implemented config parsing in `UnifiedLogger`.
- File logger is initialized with rotation, format, and log level from config if enabled.
- Stdout logger is initialized with format and log level from config if enabled.
- Redis and DB config are parsed and stored for later use.
- Error handling ensures log directories are created if needed.
- No actual logging logic is implemented yet; this step focuses on correct setup and config-driven behavior.

---

## Update: File and Stdout Logging Logic (2025-04-24)
- Implemented file and stdout logging logic in `UnifiedLogger`.
- Log records are built with metadata (timestamp, level, message, job_id, device_id, source, extra, etc.).
- Messages are routed to file and/or stdout as configured.
- Basic error handling and fallback to stdout are in place if all destinations fail.
- Redis and DB logging will be implemented in the next steps.

---

## Update: Redis and DB Logging Logic (2025-04-24)
- Implemented Redis logging: log records are published as JSON to the configured channel using the Redis client.
- Implemented DB logging: log records are saved using `save_job_log` or `save_connection_log` as appropriate.
- Robust error handling is in place for both Redis and DB logging, with warnings printed if failures occur.
- All four destinations (file, stdout, Redis, DB) are now supported in the logger utility.

---

## Update: Global Logger Instance (2025-04-24)
- Added a module-level function `get_unified_logger()` to provide a singleton instance of UnifiedLogger.
- The logger is initialized with config from the loader and can be imported and used globally across the codebase.
- Usage: `from netraven.utils.unified_logger import get_unified_logger; logger = get_unified_logger()`

---

## Update: Test Module for UnifiedLogger (2025-04-24)
- Created `tests/utils/test_unified_logger.py` with pytest-based tests for all logger destinations and error handling.
- Tests cover file, stdout, Redis (mocked), DB (mocked), error fallback, and config-driven enable/disable.
- To run tests in the containerized environment:
  `docker exec -it netraven-api-dev bash -c "cd /app && PYTHONPATH=/app poetry run pytest tests/utils/"`

---

## Update: Test Results (2025-04-24)
- All tests for UnifiedLogger passed successfully in the containerized environment.
- Command used:
  `docker exec -it netraven-api-dev bash -c "cd /app && PYTHONPATH=/app poetry run pytest tests/utils/ | cat"`
- Result: 6 tests passed, no errors. (Some unrelated Pydantic warnings.)

---

## Update: Redis Container Integration (2025-04-24)
- Updated logging config schema and documentation to support `host`, `port`, `db`, and `password` for Redis.
- UnifiedLogger now initializes the Redis client using these config options, defaulting `host` to `redis` for Docker Compose container-to-container communication.
- Example config and environment variable overrides are provided in the reference architecture.
- To verify: ensure all containers use `host: redis` and that logs are published to the correct Redis channel. Use `redis-cli` in the container to `SUBSCRIBE netraven-logs` and observe log messages.
