# Issue: Logs View "Failed to Fetch Logs" Error

**Location:** `/frontend/src/pages/Logs.vue`

---

## Summary

The Logs view displays an error message:
`Error: Failed to fetch logs`
instead of showing the logs. This indicates a failure in the frontend-to-backend data flow, likely due to an API error, data format mismatch, or connectivity/authentication issue.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

- The frontend (`Logs.vue` and `log.js` store) fetches logs from the `/logs` API endpoint.
- The error message is set if the API call fails or returns an unexpected format.
- The backend (`netraven/api/routers/logs.py`) provides a paginated `/logs` endpoint, returning a unified response for job and connection logs.
- The frontend expects a response with a structure: `{ items: [...], total_items, total_pages, current_page, page_size }` (or similar).
- If the backend response does not match this structure, or if the API call fails (network, auth, or server error), the error is shown.

**Common causes:**
- Backend returns a different structure than expected (e.g., missing `items`, `total_items`, etc.).
- Backend returns an error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error).
- Network or CORS issues.
- Database or ORM errors in the backend log query.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Preparation

- **Branch:** Create a feature branch (e.g., `bugfix/logs-fetch-error`).
- **Development Log:** Start a log at `/docs/development_log/bugfix-logs-fetch-error/`.

---

### 2. Investigation & Diagnosis

#### 2.1. Reproduce the Issue

- Open the Logs view in the UI and observe the error.
- Check the browser console and network tab for:
  - The actual API request and response.
  - HTTP status code and response body.
  - Any CORS or network errors.

#### 2.2. Backend API Response Validation

- Use an API client (e.g., Postman, curl) to call `/logs` with/without filters.
- Confirm the response structure matches what the frontend expects:
  - Should include: `items`, `total`, `page`, `size`, `pages` (or similar).
- Check for error responses (401, 403, 500, etc.) and their messages.

#### 2.3. Frontend Data Handling

- Review the `fetchLogs` method in `log.js`:
  - It expects `response.data.items` to be an array.
  - It expects pagination fields: `total_items`, `total_pages`, `current_page`, `page_size`.
- If the backend uses different field names (e.g., `total` instead of `total_items`), the frontend will fail.

---

### 3. Remediation

#### 3.1. Align API Response Structure

- **If the backend response fields differ from frontend expectations:**
  - Update the backend to return the expected field names.
  - OR update the frontend to use the actual field names from the backend.

#### 3.2. Error Handling Improvements

- Ensure the frontend displays detailed error messages for easier debugging (e.g., show HTTP status and backend error message).
- Add logging in the backend for failed log queries.

#### 3.3. Authentication/Authorization

- If the error is due to authentication (401/403), ensure the user is logged in and has the correct permissions.
- Update error messages to reflect auth issues if detected.

---

### 4. Testing

#### 4.1. Manual Testing

- Open the Logs view and verify logs are displayed.
- Apply filters and pagination; verify correct results.
- Test with no logs, many logs, and error scenarios (e.g., force a backend error).

#### 4.2. Automated Testing

- If backend tests exist for `/logs`, run:
  ```
  docker exec -it netraven-api-dev bash -c "cd /app && PYTHONPATH=/app poetry run pytest tests/api/test_logs.py"
  ```
- Add/extend frontend tests for log fetching and error handling if present.

---

### 5. Documentation & Logging

- **Update** the development log with:
  - Steps taken
  - Decisions made
  - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved

---

### 6. Version Control

- **Commit** changes in logical increments.
- **Push** the feature branch to the repository.
- **Open a pull request** for review and integration.

---

## What & Why

- **What:** Fix the logs view so it reliably fetches and displays logs, with robust error handling.
- **Why:** Ensures users can view system logs, which is critical for monitoring and troubleshooting.
