### ✅ Phase 4: Connection System Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented unified `CredentialStore` module with SQLite database backend
- ✅ Enhanced `DeviceConnector` with credential store integration
- ✅ Updated `JobDeviceConnector` with tag-based authentication
- ✅ Modified backup system to use credential store when available
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration tests for connection system
- ✅ Added database migration for credential tag support
- ✅ Created setup script for credential store initialization
- ✅ Added documentation for the credential store system

### ✅ Phase 5: API and UI Integration (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created Pinia stores for credential and tag management
- ✅ Added API endpoints for credential statistics
- ✅ Implemented credential dashboard for visualizing performance metrics
- ✅ Updated credential list component to use the new store
- ✅ Enhanced API client with methods for tag associations
- ✅ Improved navigation with links to credential dashboard
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect new credential management features

## Remaining Implementation Plan (PENDING APPROVAL)

### Phase 6: Security and Logging Enhancements (2-3 days)
- Enhance secure credential handling:
  - Implement key rotation functionality
  - Add encryption key backup/restore
  - Improve password masking throughout the system
- Implement credential usage audit logging:
  - Log all credential access events
  - Track credential modifications
  - Record authentication success/failure details
- Add memory protection for sensitive data:
  - Implement secure string handling
  - Add session-based encryption for web requests
  - Clear sensitive data from memory after use
- Create security-focused unit tests:
  - Test encryption/decryption edge cases
  - Verify access control for credential operations
  - Test audit logging accuracy

### Phase 7: Documentation and Final Testing (2-3 days)
- Document credential store architecture:
  - Create detailed technical documentation
  - Add security considerations and best practices
  - Document database schema and relationships
- Create user documentation for credential management:
  - Add step-by-step guides for common operations
  - Create troubleshooting guides
  - Add examples of effective credential organization
- Document API endpoints for credential management:
  - Update API documentation with new endpoints
  - Include request/response examples
  - Document error codes and handling
- Create end-to-end tests for the credential system:
  - Test full credential lifecycle
  - Verify integration with all components
  - Test migration path from old to new credential system
- Perform comprehensive security review:
  - Review encryption implementation
  - Test for common security vulnerabilities
  - Verify proper access control throughout the system

## Current Accomplishments

The implementation has successfully delivered:

1. **Secure Credential Storage**:
   - Implemented `Credential` and `CredentialTag` models for database storage
   - Added encryption support using Fernet symmetric encryption
   - Created a unified interface for credential management

2. **Enhanced Device Connectivity**:
   - Updated `DeviceConnector` and `JobDeviceConnector` classes with credential store integration
   - Implemented tag-based credential retrieval with prioritization
   - Added automatic retry with alternative credentials on connection failure

3. **Tracking and Optimization**:
   - Added success/failure tracking for credentials
   - Implemented tracking at both credential and credential-tag levels
   - Created a system for prioritizing the most effective credentials

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Created database migration for credential tag support
   - Updated device models to support tag-based credentials
   - Modified existing device operations to work with the credential store

5. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Added unit tests for the credential store module
   - Created integration tests for tag-based authentication
   - Implemented mocking for secure credential testing

## Next Steps

With Phases 1-4 now complete, the implementation is ready for review and approval to proceed with Phase 6 (Security and Logging Enhancements), which will make the credential store functionality accessible through the web interface.

## Additional Enhancements (Future Phases)

### User Management UI (4-5 days)
- Create Vue.js components for user management interface
- Implement CRUD operations for user accounts:
  - Create: User registration form with role selection
  - Read: User listing with search and filtering
  - Update: User profile editing and password management
  - Delete: User account deactivation/removal
- Add role-based access control management
- Implement password policy enforcement
- Create session management and activity tracking
- Add user audit logging

### Application Settings Management UI (3-4 days)
- Create centralized settings management interface
- Migrate appropriate configuration from files to database:
  - System-wide settings
  - User preferences
  - Connection defaults
  - Security policies
- Implement settings categorization (General, Security, Connections, etc.)
- Add validation for setting values
- Create export/import functionality for settings
- Implement audit logging for settings changes

### Configuration Modernization (4-5 days)
- Analyze and categorize configuration settings:
  - Environment-specific settings (remain in files)
  - Application settings (move to database/UI)
  - User preferences (move to database/UI)
- Create database schema for settings storage
- Implement API endpoints for settings management
- Add dynamic configuration loading with fallback to files
- Create configuration change notification system
- Implement configuration versioning and rollback capability
- Add configuration templating for different environments

These enhancements will modernize the application interface, improve user experience, and provide better management of the application configuration. The UI-based approach will make the system more accessible to administrators without requiring direct file access or container modifications.
