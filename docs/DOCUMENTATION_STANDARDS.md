# NetRaven Documentation Standards

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation for the NetRaven project.

## Documentation Structure

NetRaven documentation is organized into the following sections:

- **Getting Started**: Introduction, installation, and initial setup
- **User Guide**: How to use the application from a user's perspective
- **Administrator Guide**: Configuration, maintenance, and administration
- **Developer Guide**: API reference, architecture, and development workflow
- **Deployment**: Deployment scenarios, configuration, and troubleshooting
- **Reference**: Detailed reference information

## Document Types

We use several types of documents:

1. **Overview Documents**: Provide high-level introduction to a topic
2. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for accomplishing specific tasks
3. **How-To Guides**: Practical instructions for specific scenarios
4. **Reference Documents**: Detailed technical information
5. **Conceptual Guides**: Explain concepts and architectural decisions

## Standard Document Template

All documentation files should follow this basic structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Introduction
Brief overview of what the document covers and why it's important.

## Purpose
What the reader will learn or accomplish by reading this document.

## Prerequisites
What the reader needs to know or have before proceeding.

## Main Content Sections
The bulk of the document with appropriate headings.

## Troubleshooting (if applicable)
Common issues and their solutions.

## Next Steps
What to read or do next.

## Related Documentation
Links to related documents.
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Clarity and Tone

- Use clear, concise language
- Write in a conversational but professional tone
- Address the reader directly using "you" instead of "the user"
- Avoid jargon and acronyms without explanation
- Use active voice whenever possible

### Formatting and Structure

- Use appropriate Markdown headers to create a logical document structure
- Keep headers short and descriptive
- Use ordered lists for sequential steps
- Use unordered lists for non-sequential items
- Include whitespace between sections for readability
- Code blocks should include language identifiers for proper syntax highlighting

### Examples and Code

- Provide realistic examples that users can follow
- Include sample code with explanations
- Use consistent formatting for command line examples
- Clearly distinguish between inputs and outputs

## Visual Elements

### Diagrams

- Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts
- Store diagrams in the `docs/assets/diagrams` directory
- Provide text descriptions for accessibility

### Screenshots

- Include screenshots for UI-related documentation
- Store screenshots in the `docs/assets/images` directory
- Keep screenshots up-to-date with the current UI
- Use annotations to highlight important elements

## Documentation Maintenance

### Version Control

- Document changes should be committed alongside code changes
- Use descriptive commit messages for documentation changes

### Reviews

- Documentation changes should be reviewed like code changes
- Technical accuracy is the primary concern
- Secondary concerns include clarity, completeness, and adherence to standards

### Updates

- Documentation should be updated whenever related features change
- Outdated documentation should be updated or marked as deprecated
- Annual review of all documentation is recommended

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Use descriptive link text instead of "click here"
- Provide alt text for all images
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure color is not the only means of conveying information
- Use tables for tabular data with proper headers

## Machine-Readability

To improve AI tool interaction with our documentation:

- Use consistent headings and formatting
- Add semantic structure through proper Markdown usage
- Include metadata such as related documents and keywords
- Organize content logically with clear section delineation
- Use proper formatting for code, commands, and configuration examples

## Documentation Ownership

Each section of the documentation has designated owners responsible for maintaining and updating content:

- **Getting Started**: Installation Team
- **User Guide**: Product Team
- **Administrator Guide**: Operations Team
- **Developer Guide**: Development Team
- **Deployment**: DevOps Team
- **Reference**: Technical Documentation Team

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Identify Need**: Determine what documentation is needed
2. **Draft**: Create the initial document following the templates
3. **Technical Review**: Have subject matter experts review for accuracy
4. **Editorial Review**: Check for clarity, consistency, and standards
5. **Publication**: Merge into the documentation repository
6. **Maintenance**: Update as the product evolves
