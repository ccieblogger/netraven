# Testing: Intended State

This document defines the intended state of the testing framework and processes for the NetRaven application. It outlines the required testing standards, workflow, and practices that are implemented in the project.

## Testing Philosophy

NetRaven's testing approach is built on the following principles:

- Tests are an essential component of the development process
- Testing is straightforward, efficient, and aligned with the development workflow
- All code changes must have appropriate test coverage before being merged to the develop branch
- The testing framework prioritizes practical effectiveness over comprehensive complexity
- Tests provide confidence that the application behaves as intended under various conditions
- Tests run in environments that match production to ensure valid results

## Testing Categories

The NetRaven testing framework consists of the following categories:

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests validate individual components in isolation:

- Test individual functions, methods, and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on code paths and edge cases
- Are fast and deterministic
- Ensure components function correctly in isolation

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests validate that multiple components work together:

- Test interactions between components
- Test service interactions
- Focus on component contracts and interfaces
- Verify that connected components function properly together

### 3. System Functionality Tests

System functionality tests validate end-to-end workflows:

- Test complete user flows
- Test security features
- Test performance characteristics
- Validate critical business requirements

## Testing Organization

The testing code is organized in a structure that mirrors the application structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests for individual components
│   ├── core/          # Tests for core business logic components
│   ├── routers/       # Tests for API router components
│   └── web/           # Tests for web-related components
├── integration/       # Integration tests for multiple components
└── conftest.py        # Common test fixtures and configuration
```

Additional test utilities and standalone test scripts are maintained in:

```
scripts/tests/         # Standalone test scripts and utilities
```

## Development Workflow

NetRaven implements a streamlined git workflow for development and testing:

1. **Feature Branch**: All code changes begin in a feature branch created from the develop branch

2. **Feature Testing**: Tests for new functionality are written and executed within the feature branch

3. **Integration Branch**: Completed feature branches merge into an integration branch

4. **Integration Testing**: The full test suite runs in the integration branch to verify all components work together

5. **Develop Branch**: Successfully tested changes in the integration branch merge into the develop branch

This workflow ensures that code in the develop branch consistently meets quality standards.

## Testing Environment

All tests execute in the Docker-based environment that matches the deployment environment:

- Tests run inside the containerized environment
- Tests use the actual PostgreSQL database that is part of the Docker setup
- Database can be rebuilt and reinitialized for testing as needed
- Mock services are provided for simulating network devices

### Environment Consistency

The testing environment maintains strict consistency with development and production environments:

- **Database Consistency**: All environments (test, development, production) use PostgreSQL as the database. Alternative databases (e.g., SQLite) are not permitted for testing to prevent inconsistencies and codebase contamination.

- **Container Environment**: All testing must be performed within the containerized environment to ensure accurate test results that reflect real-world behavior. Testing outside the container environment is not permitted.

- **Allowed Differences**: The only permitted differences between testing, development, and production environments are:
  - Inclusion of testing libraries and frameworks
  - Debug code and instrumentation
  - Test data generators and mocks
  - Test-specific configuration settings

- **Environment Parity**: Code behavior must be identical across all environments. Any feature that works in testing must work the same way in production, with the same dependencies and configuration structure.

- **Dependency Consistency**: All environments must use the same versions of dependencies to ensure test results are valid for production environments.

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Requirements

The NetRaven project maintains the following test coverage standards:

- Core business logic: 80%+ coverage
- API routes: 70%+ coverage
- Utility functions: As appropriate based on complexity

### Test Quality Standards

All tests in the NetRaven project adhere to these quality standards:

- **Independence**: Each test is independent and does not rely on the state from other tests
- **Clarity**: Tests clearly indicate what functionality they validate
- **Reliability**: Tests produce consistent results when run multiple times
- **Efficiency**: Tests execute quickly and use resources efficiently
- **Maintainability**: Tests are easy to understand and maintain

## Test Data Management

Test data management follows these standards:

- **Fixtures**: Common test fixtures are defined centrally and reused across tests
- **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked appropriately for isolation
- **Dynamic Generation**: Test data is generated dynamically to ensure tests remain representative of real-world scenarios
- **Cleanup**: Tests properly clean up any resources they create

## Database Testing

Database testing adheres to these principles:

- **Use Production Database Type**: All database tests use PostgreSQL, matching the production environment
- **No Alternative Databases**: SQLite or other alternative databases are not used for testing, even for "quick tests"
- **Transaction Management**: Tests use appropriate transaction management to ensure proper isolation and cleanup
- **Schema Consistency**: Test databases maintain the same schema structure as production
- **Database Initialization**: Database setup and teardown procedures exist to initialize the database to a known state before tests

## Test Documentation

All test modules and functions include appropriate documentation:

- Test modules include a summary of what functionality they test
- Test functions include a docstring explaining what they validate
- Complex test setups include comments explaining the test scenario

## Security Testing

Security testing validates the following aspects:

- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization and access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- API rate limiting
- Session management

## Performance Testing

Performance testing validates the following characteristics:

- Response times under various loads
- Resource utilization
- Behavior under concurrent access
- Error handling under stress conditions

This document represents the intended state of testing in the NetRaven project and serves as the reference for all testing-related decisions and implementations.
