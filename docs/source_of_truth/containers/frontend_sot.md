## Important Product Considerations

As NetRaven is a deployable product rather than a continuously running service:

1. **Customization**: The frontend includes theming capabilities and customization options that customers can configure.

2. **Offline Support**: Critical functionality is designed to work with intermittent connectivity, ensuring a robust customer experience.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: The frontend is tested across major browsers and versions likely to be encountered in customer environments.

4. **Update Process**: Assets are versioned to ensure clean updates without requiring cache clearing or other manual steps.

5. **Diagnostics**: The frontend includes helpful diagnostic tools that customers can use to troubleshoot issues without vendor assistance.

## Coding Principles

All developers working on the NetRaven project must adhere to the following principles:

### 1. Code Quality and Maintainability

- **Prefer Simple Solutions**: Always opt for straightforward and uncomplicated approaches to problem-solving. Simple code is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Eliminate redundant code by checking for existing functionality before introducing new implementations. Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to enhance maintainability.

- **Refactor Large Files**: Keep individual files concise, ideally under 200-300 lines of code. When files exceed this length, refactor to improve readability and manageability.

### 2. Change Management

- **Scope of Changes**: Only implement changes that are explicitly requested or directly related to the task at hand. Unnecessary modifications can introduce errors and complicate code reviews.

- **Introduce New Patterns Cautiously**: When addressing bugs or issues, exhaust all options within the existing implementation before introducing new patterns or technologies. If a new approach is necessary, ensure that the old implementation is removed to prevent duplicate logic and legacy code.

- **Code Refactoring Process**: Code refactoring, enhancements, or changes of any significance should be done in a git feature branch and reintroduced back into the codebase through an integration branch after all changes have been successfully tested.

### 3. Resource Management

- **Clean Up Temporary Resources**: Remove temporary files or code when they are no longer needed to maintain a clean and efficient codebase.

- **Avoid Temporary Scripts in Files**: Refrain from writing scripts directly into files, especially if they are intended for one-time or temporary use. This practice helps maintain code clarity and organization.

### 4. Testing Practices

- **Use Mock Data Appropriately**: Employ mocking data exclusively for testing purposes. Avoid using mock or fake data in development or production environments to ensure data integrity and reliability.

- **Test Coverage**: Strive for comprehensive test coverage of new functionality, with particular attention to edge cases and error conditions.

### 5. Communication and Collaboration

- **Propose and Await Approval for Plans**: When tasked with updates, enhancements, creation, or issue resolution, present a detailed plan outlining the proposed changes. Break the plan into phases to manage complexity and await approval before proceeding.

- **Seek Permission Before Advancing Phases**: Before moving on to the next phase of your plan, always obtain approval to ensure alignment with project goals and stakeholder expectations.

- **Version Control Practices**: After successfully completing each phase, perform a git state check, commit the changes, and push them to the repository. This ensures a reliable version history and facilitates collaboration.

- **Document Processes Clearly**: Without being overly verbose, provide clear explanations of your actions during coding, testing, or implementing changes. This transparency aids understanding and knowledge sharing among team members.

- **Development Log**: Always maintain a log of your changes, insights, and any other relevant information another developer could use to pick up where you left off to complete the current task. Store this log in the `./docs/development_logs/` folder in a folder named after the feature branch you are working on.
