# Documentation Maintenance Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines the processes and best practices for maintaining the NetRaven documentation. Regular maintenance ensures that documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and valuable to users as the product evolves.

## Maintenance Roles and Responsibilities

### Documentation Owner

The documentation owner has overall responsibility for the quality and completeness of the documentation. Their responsibilities include:

- Ensuring documentation meets established standards
- Coordinating regular reviews
- Approving significant changes
- Managing the documentation roadmap
- Tracking documentation issues and feedback

### Technical Writers

Technical writers are responsible for:

- Creating and updating documentation content
- Ensuring consistent tone, style, and formatting
- Implementing feedback from subject matter experts
- Conducting documentation testing (verifying procedures)
- Maintaining documentation structure and organization

### Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)

SMEs provide technical expertise and are responsible for:

- Reviewing documentation for technical accuracy
- Updating content related to their area of expertise
- Identifying gaps in documentation
- Providing technical details for new features

### Documentation Contributors

Anyone who contributes to the documentation, including:

- Making minor corrections
- Reporting documentation issues
- Suggesting improvements
- Contributing content for review

## Maintenance Processes

### Regular Review Cycle

Documentation should be reviewed on a regular basis:

1. **Quarterly Light Review**
   - Check for broken links
   - Update screenshots if UI has changed
   - Verify configuration examples and code snippets
   - Update version references

2. **Bi-Annual Deep Review**
   - Review all content for accuracy
   - Identify outdated information
   - Update all examples to current best practices
   - Verify all procedures with the latest software version
   - Review user feedback and address common issues

3. **Annual Comprehensive Audit**
   - Complete content audit
   - Restructure if necessary
   - Evaluate against documentation standards
   - Review and update metadata, tags, and categorization
   - Assess performance against user metrics

### Feature-Driven Updates

For each new feature or significant change:

1. **Pre-Release Documentation Planning**
   - Identify documentation requirements
   - Determine affected documentation sections
   - Assign writing tasks to appropriate SMEs/writers
   - Create documentation tickets

2. **Documentation Development**
   - Create or update required content
   - Review with feature developers
   - Incorporate screenshots and examples
   - Conduct documentation testing

3. **Release Synchronization**
   - Publish documentation in sync with feature release
   - Update version references
   - Add to release notes or changelog
   - Review for cross-references to new content

### Bug-Driven Updates

For documentation bugs or issues:

1. **Issue Tracking**
   - Log all documentation issues in the tracking system
   - Categorize by severity and documentation area
   - Assign to appropriate team member

2. **Resolution Process**
   - Investigate and verify the issue
   - Make necessary corrections
   - Get technical review if needed
   - Update related content if affected

3. **Verification**
   - Validate that the fix addresses the reported issue
   - Check that no new issues were introduced
   - Close the issue with reference to the fix

## Documentation Version Control

### Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**
   - Contains current production documentation
   - Protected from direct commits

2. **Development Branch**
   - Working branch for upcoming release
   - Contains documentation for features in development

3. **Feature Branches**
   - Created for specific documentation updates
   - Named according to the feature or update

### Version Tagging

- Documentation should be tagged with the corresponding software version
- Major versions should be tagged in the repository
- Consider maintaining version-specific branches for major versions

## Documentation Testing

### Procedure Verification

Before publishing updates:

1. Follow all procedures step-by-step in a test environment
2. Verify that commands and examples work as documented
3. Confirm that screenshots match the current UI
4. Test on different environments if applicable (OS, browsers, etc.)

### Technical Review

All technical content should undergo:

1. Peer review by another writer for clarity and style
2. Technical review by an SME for accuracy
3. Final review by documentation owner for standards compliance

## Deprecation and Archiving

### Deprecation Process

When features are deprecated:

1. Mark affected documentation as deprecated
2. Add warning notices with deprecation timeline
3. Link to alternative or replacement features
4. Keep documentation available until feature is removed

### Archiving Process

For documentation no longer relevant:

1. Move content to an archive section if historically valuable
2. Remove from main navigation but keep accessible via search
3. Clearly mark as archived with appropriate version information
4. Consider maintaining offline archives for older versions

## Documentation Metrics and Feedback

### Collecting Feedback

Implement methods to gather user feedback:

1. **Satisfaction Surveys**
   - Regular pulse surveys on documentation quality
   - Page-level feedback mechanisms ("Was this helpful?")

2. **Usage Analytics**
   - Track most/least visited pages
   - Identify search terms with no results
   - Analyze time spent on pages
   - Monitor external links to documentation

3. **Support Ticket Analysis**
   - Review support tickets for documentation gaps
   - Track tickets resolved by documentation references

### Acting on Feedback

1. Prioritize improvements based on feedback frequency and impact
2. Address high-priority issues in the next maintenance cycle
3. Add common issues to FAQ sections
4. Report on feedback trends to guide documentation strategy
