# Phase 3.1: Async Support Implementation

## Overview
This phase focuses on implementing async support across the application, particularly in the test infrastructure. The goal is to ensure proper async testing capabilities while maintaining code quality and following best practices.

## Changes Made
1. Removed incorrectly created test files
2. Reverted changes to Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
3. Created comprehensive async test cases for admin settings:
   - User management tests
   - Role management tests
   - Permission management tests
   - System settings tests
4. Created comprehensive async test cases for device management:
   - Device CRUD operations
   - Device filtering tests
   - Device tag operations
   - Device backup status tracking
5. Implemented comprehensive test suite for async scheduler service:
   - Core scheduler functionality tests
   - Database integration tests
   - Error handling and edge case tests

## Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Analysis** ✓
   - Review existing test patterns
   - Identify async support requirements
   - Document findings

2. **Phase 2: Async Test Implementation** (In Progress)
   - Update test fixtures for async support ✓
   - Implement async test cases for admin settings ✓
   - Implement async test cases for device management ✓
   - Implement async test cases for job scheduling ✓
   - Implement async test cases for backup management

3. **Phase 3: Test Integration**
   - Update database configuration for async testing
   - Configure test environment variables
   - Implement test data cleanup

4. **Phase 4: CI/CD Integration**
   - Update CI/CD pipeline commands
   - Add async test coverage reporting
   - Configure test parallelization

## Coding Principles
- Maintain simplicity in test implementations
- Avoid code duplication
- Clean up test data after each test
- Follow async/await best practices
- Use proper assertion patterns
- Implement comprehensive error handling

## Progress Log
1. Initial plan creation and documentation setup
2. Removed incorrect test files and reverted container changes
3. Created documentation file
4. Analyzed existing test infrastructure
5. Updated test fixtures for async support
6. Implemented comprehensive async test cases for admin settings:
   - User management CRUD operations
   - Role management CRUD operations
   - Permission management CRUD operations
   - System settings operations
7. Implemented comprehensive async test cases for device management:
   - Device CRUD operations
   - Device filtering tests
   - Device tag operations
   - Device backup status tracking
8. Implemented comprehensive test suite for async scheduler service:
   - Created core functionality tests in test_async_scheduler_service.py:
     - Job scheduling with various parameters
     - Job priority handling in the queue
     - Job status tracking and retrieval
     - Job cancellation
     - Job execution for different job types
     - Error handling during job execution
     - Service start/stop lifecycle
     - Job queue processing
   - Created integration tests in test_async_scheduler_service_integration.py:
     - Database integration for job persistence
     - Recurrent job scheduling (daily, weekly, monthly)
     - Processing of due jobs
     - Job next execution time calculation
   - Created error handling tests in test_async_scheduler_service_error_handling.py:
     - Exception handling during job execution
     - Database error handling
     - Queue full handling
     - Job execution timeout handling
     - Device not found handling
     - Invalid job parameters validation
     - Concurrent job execution testing
     - Job cancellation during execution
     - Error recovery in job processing
   - Added comprehensive README with test documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement backup management test cases
2. Update test database configuration for async operations
3. Implement test data cleanup mechanisms
4. Add CI/CD integration for async tests

## Note on Test Execution
Current tests for async_scheduler_service cannot be executed due to a dependency issue with SQLAlchemy's NullPool in the project's conftest.py file. This will need to be addressed separately to make the tests runnable.
