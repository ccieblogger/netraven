# Documentation Reorganization

This document summarizes the reorganization of the NetRaven documentation to provide a more structured and maintainable documentation system.

## Overview

The documentation has been reorganized to follow industry best practices for technical documentation, with a clear structure and consistent formatting.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created a Standardized Documentation Structure

- **architecture/**: Architecture documentation describing system components and design decisions
- **guides/developer/**: Developer guides and best practices
- **guides/user/**: End-user documentation
- **implementation/**: Documentation of implementation details and progress
- **reference/**: Technical reference documentation

### 2. Migrated Content from Multiple Sources

- **aidocs/ content**: Migrated implementation plans and development logs to `docs/implementation/`
- **Component READMEs**: Consolidated documentation from component-specific READMEs into the central documentation
- **Sphinx files**: Removed and replaced with Markdown-based documentation

### 3. Created Consistent Documentation Standards

- Standardized on Markdown format for all documentation
- Added a documentation README with guidelines and best practices
- Implemented consistent document structure and formatting

### 4. Added Cross-References

- Updated the main documentation index to include all documentation sections
- Added references between related documentation
- Created placeholders in component directories pointing to the main documentation

## Files Created or Updated

### New Documentation Files

- **docs/README.md**: Documentation standards and guidelines
- **docs/index.md**: Main documentation index
