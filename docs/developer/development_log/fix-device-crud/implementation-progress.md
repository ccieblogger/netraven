# Device CRUD System Implementation Progress Log

## 2025-04-15: Initial Analysis and Planning

### Goals
- Fix the device CRUD system to properly implement tag-based credential association
- Remove direct credential selection from device form
- Add UI elements to display matching credentials for devices

### Current State Analysis
After analyzing the codebase, I've identified the following:

1. **Database Structure**
   - The database already has the necessary many-to-many relationship tables:
     - `device_tag_association` links devices to tags
     - `credential_tag_association` links credentials to tags
   - The SQL model relationships are properly defined in the models

2. **Frontend Issues**
   - The device form currently has a direct credential selector that should be removed
   - The device list doesn't show information about matching credentials
   - No UI exists to display multiple credentials per device

3. **Backend Issues**
   - No service or endpoint exists to find matching credentials for a device
   - The device listing API doesn't include credential count information

### Key Observations
- Tag-based credential matching is the intended design but not fully implemented
- Credentials have a priority field (lower number = higher priority)
- The system should try credentials in priority order
- The device communication service needs to find matching credentials by tag

### Revised Implementation Plan
I've reviewed the existing implementation plan and made the following refinements:

1. **Backend Service Layer**
   - Create a dedicated service for credential matching logic
   - Implement a new API endpoint to get matching credentials for a device
   - Enhance the device list endpoint to include credential counts

2. **Frontend Updates**
   - Remove direct credential selection from device form
   - Add explanatory text about tag-based credential association
   - Update the device store to fetch matching credentials
   - Modify the device list to display credential count and details

3. **Project Structure Improvements**
   - Create a services directory to maintain separation of concerns

The complete detailed implementation plan is documented in `implementation-plan.md`.

### Next Steps
1. Create the service directory structure
2. Implement the credential matching service
3. Begin backend API enhancements

## Planned Implementation Sequence
1. Create the service directory structure
2. Implement the DeviceCredentialService
3. Add the new API endpoint for device credentials
4. Modify the device list endpoint to include credential count
5. Update the device schema with the credential count field
6. Update the frontend device store with credential fetching
7. Update the device form to remove direct credential selection
8. Update the device list display to show credential information
9. Test the full implementation
10. Update documentation
