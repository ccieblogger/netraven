# Development Log: Issue #11 - Ensure Every Device Has At Least One Credential

## Summary
This log documents the investigation, implementation, and testing for [GitHub Issue #11](https://github.com/ccieblogger/netraven/issues/11):

> Guarantee that every device has at least one credential associated at creation. If none are matched, explicitly associate the default credential (by adding the default tag).

---

## Analysis & Planning
- **Reviewed** the device creation logic in `netraven/api/routers/devices.py`.
- **Identified** that the system previously only added the default tag if it existed, but did not guarantee a matching credential.
- **Drafted** a phased implementation plan:
  1. Backend logic update
  2. Testing
  3. Documentation
  4. Git workflow

## Implementation
- **Backend:**
  - Updated device creation endpoint to check for matching credentials after creation.
  - If none match, the default tag is enforced; if still no credentials, an error is raised.
  - If the default tag is missing, a clear error is returned.
- **Tests:**
  - Added/updated tests to ensure:
    - Every device has at least one matching credential after creation.
    - The default credential is assigned if no others match.
    - Errors are raised if the default tag or credential is missing.
  - Adjusted test setup to always create a default credential for successful device creation tests.
- **Test Results:**
  - All device API tests pass, confirming the new logic is robust and correct.

## Key Decisions
- The default tag is always enforced on device creation and update.
- Device creation fails with a clear error if no credentials match, even after adding the default tag.
- Tests were updated to reflect the new requirements and backend behavior.
