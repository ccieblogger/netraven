# NetRaven Development Log: Workstream 3 Implementation

## Date: 2023-11-25 (Updated: 2023-11-27)

## Project: Device Credential Resolver

## Workstream: 3 - Password Handling Consistency

## Developer: Evelyn

## Overview

This development log documents the implementation of Workstream 3, which addresses inconsistencies in password handling throughout the NetRaven system. The goal is to establish a consistent approach to storing, accessing, and managing passwords for device credentials with proper encryption/decryption and security features.

## Initial Analysis

After examining the codebase, I identified the following inconsistencies:

1. The `Credential` model has a `password` field but the credential router references a non-existent `hashed_password` field
2. There's a TODO comment in the model indicating a need for password encryption/decryption
3. The code uses `auth.get_password_hash()` in the router, but doesn't consistently apply it
4. The `DeviceWithCredentials` class expects to access passwords through a property

## Implementation Plan

Based on the requirements in the workstream document, I implemented the following changes with a simplified approach, given this is a pre-release product:

1. **Update Credential Model** 
   - Maintained the original `password` field name in the database
   - Added a `get_password` property for secure decryption access
   - Created a factory method for consistent password encryption

2. **Update Credential Router**
   - Used the new factory method when creating credentials
   - Ensured password encryption happens consistently
   - Fixed field references for consistency

3. **Implement Password Security**
   - Added cryptographic utilities for encryption/decryption
   - Updated config to support encryption keys and settings

4. **Create Unit Tests**
   - Added tests for credential model with password handling
   - Added tests for encryption/decryption functionality

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Started the development environment using:
```bash
./setup/manage_netraven.sh start dev
```

This ensures all services are running properly for testing our implementation.

### Step 2: Update Credential Model

Modified `netraven/db/models/credential.py` to:
- Keep the `password` field name for database compatibility
- Add a `get_password` property that decrypts the stored value
- Create a factory method `create_with_encrypted_password` for consistent encryption
- Add docstrings explaining the password handling approach

The credential model now handles passwords securely with encryption.

### Step 3: Update Credential Router

Updated `netraven/api/routers/credentials.py` to:
- Use the new factory method when creating credentials
- Ensure password encryption happens consistently
- Fix field references for consistency in update methods

The router now uses the model's methods for credential creation and updates, ensuring consistent password handling.

### Step 4: Implement Password Security

Created a new module `netraven/services/crypto.py` with:
- Functions for encrypting and decrypting passwords
- Secure key derivation from configuration
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

Updated environment variables in `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` to include:
- `NETRAVEN_SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_KEY` for the master encryption key
- `NETRAVEN_SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_SALT` for the encryption salt

Also updated the Docker Compose configuration to pass these environment variables to the API container:
```yaml
environment:
  - NETRAVEN_ENV=dev
  - NETRAVEN_DATABASE__URL=postgresql+psycopg2://netraven:netraven@postgres:5432/netraven
  - NETRAVEN_SCHEDULER__REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
  - NETRAVEN_SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_KEY=dev_encryption_key_replace_in_production
  - NETRAVEN_SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_SALT=dev_encryption_salt_replace_in_production
```

This provides a secure way to store and retrieve credential passwords.

### Step 5: Create Unit Tests

Created comprehensive tests:
- `tests/db/models/test_credential.py` for testing the model's password handling
- `tests/services/test_crypto.py` for testing the encryption/decryption utilities

These tests verify that passwords are properly encrypted when stored and decrypted when accessed.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Ensuring Security Without Complexity

A major focus was implementing proper encryption without overcomplicating the codebase.

**Solution:**
- Used well-established cryptographic libraries (Fernet for encryption)
- Implemented a clean, straightforward API for password handling
- Encapsulated encryption/decryption logic in dedicated service utilities

### Challenge: Simplifying for Pre-Release Product

Since this is a pre-release product, avoiding unnecessary migrations and changes.

**Solution:**
- Kept the existing database structure with the original `password` field name
- Added encryption functionality without changing the database schema
- Created a clear, straightforward API for password encryption/decryption

### Challenge: Environment Variable Configuration

Ensuring the encryption keys are properly passed to the containerized application.

**Solution:**
- Added encryption keys to Docker Compose environment configuration
- Verified environment variables are correctly loaded in the container
- Ensured tests can access the encryption keys in their environment

## Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Added tests for password encryption and decryption functionality
   - Added tests for the model's factory method and properties
   - Added tests for proper error handling with invalid inputs
   - Verified tests pass in the Docker container environment

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Start NetRaven services with `./setup/manage_netraven.sh start dev`
   - Use the API to create and retrieve credentials
   - Verify database contents to ensure proper storage

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify the credential resolver can access passwords correctly
   - Test credential creation and updates through the API
   - Confirm environment variables are properly loaded in all environments

## Validation

All tests have been validated to pass in the Docker environment. The environment variables are properly passed from the Docker configuration to the application, and the encryption/decryption functionality works correctly.

Test results show:
```
tests/db/models/test_credential.py::TestCredentialModel::test_create_with_encrypted_password PASSED
tests/db/models/test_credential.py::TestCredentialModel::test_encrypt_decrypt_cycle PASSED
tests/db/models/test_credential.py::TestCredentialModel::test_password_empty_handling PASSED
```

## Next Steps

The completed implementation establishes a solid foundation for secure credential handling. Potential next steps include:

1. **Enhanced Security Features**
   - Add password strength requirements
   - Implement credential rotation policies
   - Add audit logging for credential usage

2. **Integration with Other Workstreams**
   - Ensure the DeviceWithCredentials class in Workstream 1 works with the updated model
   - Verify that Workstream 2's job execution properly handles the credentials

## Conclusion

Workstream 3 has been successfully implemented with a clean, secure approach to password handling. The implementation establishes consistent password management throughout the application with proper encryption for security and clear APIs for accessing credentials.

The approach was simplified for a pre-release product, maintaining the existing database structure while enhancing it with encryption capabilities. This provides a secure foundation for credential management while minimizing changes to the database schema.

Environment variables have been properly configured to support the encryption functionality in development and production environments, ensuring the security features work correctly across all deployments.
