# Development Log: feature/ui-dashboard-refinement

**Date:** 2025-04-15

**Developer:** Marcus

**Branch:** feature/ui-dashboard-refinement

**Goal:** Refactor the UI to match the provided screenshot, including color palette, fonts, layout, icons, etc.

## Phase 1: CORS Configuration Fix

**Issue:** Authentication was failing due to CORS policy blocking requests from the frontend (running on http://127.0.0.1:5173) to the backend API (running on http://localhost:8000).

**Changes:**
1. Updated the CORS configuration in `netraven/api/main.py` to include the additional origin:
   - Added "http://127.0.0.1:5173" and "http://127.0.0.1:5174" to the `allow_origins` list

2. Added `withCredentials: true` to the Axios configuration in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
   - This ensures that cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates are properly sent with cross-origin requests

3. Updated `API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to explicitly use "http://localhost:8000"

**Rationale:**
- The CORS policy was preventing the frontend from making authenticated requests to the backend
- The `withCredentials` option is required when the frontend needs to include credentials (like Authorization headers) in cross-origin requests
- This change aligns with the backend's CORS middleware which already had `allow_credentials=True` configured

**Results:**
- The login issue has been resolved and users can now authenticate successfully

## Phase 2: UI Refactoring Plan

Based on the provided screenshot, I'll implement the following changes to refactor the UI:

### 2.1 Dashboard Layout Refinement
1. Update the `Dashboard.vue` component to match the layout in the screenshot
   - Modify header to show "Welcome to NetRaven" with the subtitle "Network Configuration Management System"
   - Create three card components for Devices, Jobs, and Credentials with the correct styling
   - Implement the Recent Activity section with a loading spinner
   - Ensure all component spacing and sizing matches the screenshot

### 2.2 Color Palette Adjustment
1. Update the Tailwind configuration if necessary to match the color scheme in the screenshot
   - Main background: Deep blue (#0D1321)
   - Sidebar: Navy blue (#1e3a8a)
   - Cards: Device card (blue), Job card (green), Credentials card (purple)
   - Make sure all elements use the correct colors from the palette

### 2.3 Font and Typography Refinement
1. Ensure typography styles match the screenshot
   - Header font sizes and weights
   - Card text styling
   - "View Details" link styling

### 2.4 Icon Implementation
1. Update or replace icons to match those in the screenshot
   - Device icon in the blue card
   - Job icon in the green card
   - Credentials icon in the purple card

### 2.5 Card Styling
1. Standardize card styling across components
   - Add proper shadows, borders, and rounded corners
   - Implement the card header/footer pattern seen in the screenshot

### 2.6 Testing
1. Test the UI on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness
2. Verify the correct display of all elements in both light and dark modes
3. Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons) work correctly

## Implementation Approach:
1. Start with updating the global styles and Tailwind configuration
2. Refactor the Dashboard component first, ensuring it matches the screenshot exactly
3. Update the DefaultLayout component if necessary for global layout changes
4. Create any new reusable components needed for consistent styling
5. Test the changes thoroughly before committing

## Phase 3: Implementation of UI Changes

**Date:** 2025-04-15

**Changes:**

### 3.1 Global Styles Update
1. Added global CSS styles in `frontend/src/App.vue`:
   - Set the main background color to #0D1321 (Rich Black)
   - Created custom utility classes:
     - `.netraven-card` for card styling with proper border-radius, shadows, and borders
     - `.icon-container` for circular icon containers
     - `.stat-counter` for large numeric counters
     - `.view-details` for "View Details" links

### 3.2 Dashboard Component Refactoring
1. Updated `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.vue`:
   - Applied the `.netraven-card` class to all card components
   - Updated colors to match the screenshot (bg-blue-700, bg-green-700, bg-purple-700, etc.)
   - Styled card headers, counters, and footer sections to match the design
   - Used consistent spacing and font sizes across all elements
   - Updated the Recent Activity section with the correct border styling and loading indicator

### 3.3 Layout Component Refactoring
1. Updated `frontend/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`:
   - Changed the sidebar background color to match the screenshot (#0D1321)
   - Updated the NetRaven logo to use `<span>` elements with different colors
   - Styled navigation links with proper hover effects
   - Applied a semi-transparent background for active routes
   - Added CSS for proper active link indicator (green icon highlight)
   - Updated border opacity for a more subtle appearance

### 3.4 Tailwind Configuration Update
1. Updated `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to define the custom color palette:
   - Added specific blue colors (including #0D1321 for main background)
   - Enhanced green colors for Jobs card and accents
   - Updated purple colors for Credentials card
   - Added descriptive comments for each color's purpose

**Rationale:**
- These changes bring the UI in line with the design in the screenshot
- Using utility classes improves consistency across components
- The color scheme now follows the intended design with rich blues, greens, and purples
- The layout now properly emphasizes the dashboard cards and navigation
- The Tailwind configuration ensures consistent color usage throughout the application

## Phase 4: Final UI Refinements

**Date:** 2025-04-16

**Changes:**

### 4.1 Icon Refinements
1. Updated all SVG icons in `frontend/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`:
   - Added clear comments for each icon type
   - Improved readability of SVG code with proper indentation and formatting
   - Replaced the logs icon with a document-style icon instead of the trash icon to better match the reference

### 4.2 Card Styling Fine-tuning
1. Refined card styling in `frontend/src/App.vue`:
   - Adjusted border-radius to 0.375rem for more subtle rounding
   - Reduced shadow intensity for a more subtle appearance
   - Decreased border opacity from 0.2 to 0.1 to match the reference
   - Added fixed dimensions for icon containers (3rem Ã— 3rem)
   - Added line-height: 1 to the stat counter for tighter vertical spacing

### 4.3 Dashboard Layout Fine-tuning
1. Made sure all SVG icons in cards had appropriate comments and consistent sizing

**Rationale:**
- These final refinements ensure the UI precisely matches the reference screenshot
- The more subtle shadows and borders create a cleaner, more professional appearance
- Consistent icon sizing and styling across all components improves visual harmony
- The updated document icon for logs better represents the functionality of that section
