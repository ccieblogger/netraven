**Date:** 2025-04-15

**Developer:** Marcus

**Branch:** feature/ui-dashboard-refinement

**Goal:** Refactor the UI to match the provided screenshot, including color palette, fonts, layout, icons, etc.

## Phase 1: CORS Configuration Fix

**Issue:** Authentication was failing due to CORS policy blocking requests from the frontend (running on http://127.0.0.1:5173) to the backend API (running on http://localhost:8000).

**Changes:**
1. Updated the CORS configuration in `netraven/api/main.py` to include the additional origin:
   - Added "http://127.0.0.1:5173" and "http://127.0.0.1:5174" to the `allow_origins` list

2. Added `withCredentials: true` to the Axios configuration in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
   - This ensures that cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates are properly sent with cross-origin requests

**Rationale:**
- The CORS policy was preventing the frontend from making authenticated requests to the backend
- The `withCredentials` option is required when the frontend needs to include credentials (like Authorization headers) in cross-origin requests
- This change aligns with the backend's CORS middleware which already had `allow_credentials=True` configured

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with the UI refactoring to match the provided screenshot
