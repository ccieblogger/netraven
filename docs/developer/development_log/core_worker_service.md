**Phase:** Configuration Integration (Phase 10 Start)

**Goal:** Refactor worker components to load configurable values (thread pool size, Git path, redaction keywords) from a central configuration mechanism instead of using hardcoded defaults.

**Plan:**
- Assume existence of `netraven.config.loader.load_config()`.
- Modify `redactor.redact` to accept an optional `config` dictionary and load `worker.redaction.patterns` from it, falling back to defaults.

- Modify `dispatcher.dispatch_tasks` to accept an optional `config` dictionary, load `worker.thread_pool_size` from it, and pass the `config` dict down to `executor.handle_device`.
- Modify `runner.run_job` to call `load_config()` at the beginning and pass the resulting `config` dictionary down to `dispatcher.dispatch_tasks`.
- Update function signatures and docstrings.
- Keep fallback defaults in case config values are missing or invalid.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Modified `redactor.py` to load keywords from config.

**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Phase:** Integration Testing & Refinement (Phase 11 Start)

**Goal:** Add integration tests, implement connection retry logic, and perform final code cleanup.

**Plan:**
- **Retry Logic:**
    - Modify `executor.handle_device` to include a retry loop around the `netmiko_driver.run_command` call.
    - Load `worker.retry_attempts` and `worker.retry_backoff` from config, with defaults.
    - Retry only on specific connection exceptions (e.g., `NetmikoTimeoutException`).
    - Do not retry on authentication errors (`NetmikoAuthenticationException`).
    - Use `time.sleep()` for backoff.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - Create `tests/worker/test_runner_integration.py`.
    - Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock external dependencies (`load_config`, DB interactions, `netmiko_driver.run_command`, `log_utils.*`, `git_writer.*`, `time.sleep`).
    - Create test cases for `runner.run_job` covering:
        - All devices successful.
        - Mix of success, timeout (with successful retry), auth failure, Git failure.
        - No devices found for job.
        - Exception during device loading.
    - Assert calls to mocked functions (status updates, logging, Netmiko, Git) and final job status.
- **Refinement:**
    - Remove placeholder `MockDevice` class and `load_devices_for_job`/`update_job_status` functions from `runner.py`, replacing with calls assuming real DB models/session.
    - Switch `runner.py` to use standard `logging` instead of `print`.
    - Remove excessive informational `print` statements from `executor.py`, keeping essential error/retry messages.
- **Commit:** Commit tests and refinements.

**Progress:**
- Added retry logic to `executor.handle_device` based on config values.
- Created `tests/worker/test_runner_integration.py` with mocked integration tests for `run_job`, covering various success/failure scenarios including retries.
- Fixed linter errors in test file by nesting `patch` context managers.
- Removed placeholder functions/class from `runner.py` and replaced with assumed DB model/session usage.
- Switched `runner.py` to use Python's standard `logging` module.
- Removed most informational `print` statements from `executor.py`.

**Next Steps:** Commit the final changes for the worker service implementation.

**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Phase:** DB Integration - Phase 1: Define/Verify Core SQLAlchemy Models

**Goal:** Ensure SQLAlchemy models required by the worker service exist and match the SOT.

**Plan:**
- Check existence and content of `job.py`, `device.py`, `job_log.py`, `connection_log.py`, `__init__.py`, `base.py`, `session.py`.
- Verify model definitions against `postgresql_sot.md`.
- Add/modify models as needed.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Verified existing model files and DB setup files (`session.py`, `base.py`).
- `Job`, `Device`, `ConnectionLog` models generally match SOT.
- Identified missing `device_id` in `JobLog` model.
- Added `device_id` column (ForeignKey to `devices.id`) and `device` relationship to `JobLog` model in `netraven/db/models/job_log.py`.
- Noted potential discrepancy: SOT `Job` model has `device_id` (one device per job), while worker integration tests used multiple devices per job. Proceeding with current model structure for now.

**Next Steps:** Commit model update.

**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Phase:** DB Integration - Phase 2: Update Initial Alembic Revision

**Goal:** Ensure the initial Alembic revision file accurately reflects the required schema for the worker service.

**Plan:**
- Identify the initial revision file in `alembic/versions/`.
- Read the file to check existing table definitions.
- Modify the `upgrade()` function to add/correct table definitions for `jobs`, `job_logs`, `connection_logs` as needed, based on SOT and model changes.
- Specifically, add the `device_id` column, FK constraint, and index to the `job_logs` table definition.
- Modify the `downgrade()` function to correctly drop added indexes/tables.
- Commit the updated revision file.

**Progress:**
- Identified initial revision: `a3992da91329_initial_schema_definition.py`.
- Verified it already contained definitions for `jobs`, `job_logs`, `connection_logs`.
- Edited the `upgrade()` function in the revision file to add `sa.Column('device_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True)`, `sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['device_id'], ['devices.id'], ondelete='CASCADE')`, and `op.create_index(op.f('ix_job_logs_device_id'), 'job_logs', ['device_id'], unique=False)` to the `job_logs` table creation.
- Edited the `downgrade()` function to add `op.drop_index(op.f('ix_job_logs_device_id'), table_name='job_logs')`.

**Next Steps:** Commit the Alembic revision file update.

    - Modify `update_job_status` to ensure compatibility with `Job` model attributes.
    - Adjust main `run_job` logic to handle a single device being loaded and processed.
    - Add helper `log_runner_error` to log critical errors to `JobLog`.
- Commit refactored code.

**Progress:**
- Refactored `log_utils.py` to use actual models, session, and logging.

    - Renamed `load_devices_for_job` to `load_device_for_job` and updated query logic for the one-to-one Job-Device relationship.
    - Adjusted `run_job` logic to expect a single device and process the single result from the dispatcher.
    - Added `log_runner_error` helper.
    - Ensured `db.close()` is called in `finally` block.

**Next Steps:** Commit the refactored worker code.
