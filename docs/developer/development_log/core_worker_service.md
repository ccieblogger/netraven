**Phase:** Executor Logic Implementation (Phase 7 Start)

**Goal:** Implement the main orchestrator function (`handle_device`) that ties together the different worker components for processing a single device.

**Plan:**
- Implement `handle_device` in `netraven/worker/executor.py`.
- Add imports for other worker components (`netmiko_driver`, `redactor`, `log_utils`, `git_writer`) and relevant exceptions (`Netmiko*Exception`, `GitCommandError`).
- Define the sequence of operations:
    1. Call `netmiko_driver.run_command`.
    2. Call `redactor.redact` on the result.
    3. Call `log_utils.save_connection_log` with the *redacted* output.
    4. Call `git_writer.commit_configuration_to_git` with the *raw* output and repo path.
    5. Call `log_utils.save_job_log` based on success/failure of the previous steps (including commit hash if successful).
- Wrap the sequence in a `try...except` block to catch specific and general exceptions.
- Log appropriate errors using `save_job_log` in `except` blocks.
- Consider logging partial connection logs on error if data was retrieved before failure.

**Phase:** Configuration Integration (Phase 10 Start)

**Goal:** Refactor worker components to load configurable values (thread pool size, Git path, redaction keywords) from a central configuration mechanism instead of using hardcoded defaults.

**Plan:**
- Assume existence of `netraven.config.loader.load_config()`.
- Modify `redactor.redact` to accept an optional `config` dictionary and load `worker.redaction.patterns` from it, falling back to defaults.
- Modify `executor.handle_device` to accept an optional `config` dictionary, load `worker.git_repo_path` from it, and pass the `config` dict down to `redactor.redact`.
- Modify `dispatcher.dispatch_tasks` to accept an optional `config` dictionary, load `worker.thread_pool_size` from it, and pass the `config` dict down to `executor.handle_device`.
- Modify `runner.run_job` to call `load_config()` at the beginning and pass the resulting `config` dictionary down to `dispatcher.dispatch_tasks`.
- Update function signatures and docstrings.
- Keep fallback defaults in case config values are missing or invalid.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Modified `redactor.py` to load keywords from config.
- Modified `executor.py` to load git repo path from config and pass config to `redact`.
- Modified `dispatcher.py` to load thread pool size from config and pass config to `handle_device`.
