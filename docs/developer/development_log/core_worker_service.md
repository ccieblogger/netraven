# Development Log: core/worker - Device Communication Service

**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Developer:** Gemini

**Branch:** core/worker

**Phase:** Initial Setup (Phase 1 Start)

**Goal:** Establish the basic directory structure, placeholder files, and development log for the Device Communication Worker service as per the approved plan.

**Plan:**
- Create directories: `netraven/worker/`, `netraven/worker/backends/`
- Create `__init__.py` files in new directories.
- Create placeholder Python files: `runner.py`, `dispatcher.py`, `executor.py`, `redactor.py`, `log_utils.py`, `git_writer.py`, `backends/netmiko_driver.py`.
- Create development log file: `docs/developer/development_log/core_worker_service.md`
- Commit initial structure.

**Progress:**
- Created directories and placeholder files via terminal commands.
- Created this development log file.

**Next Steps:** Commit the changes.

**Phase:** Core Component Signatures & Interfaces (Phase 2 Start)

**Goal:** Define the basic function signatures and interfaces for each core component of the worker service.

**Plan:**
- Add function signatures with type hints and basic docstrings to:
    - `redactor.py`
    - `backends/netmiko_driver.py`
    - `log_utils.py`
    - `git_writer.py`
    - `executor.py`
    - `dispatcher.py`
    - `runner.py`
- Use `pass` for initial implementation.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Added function signatures and docstrings to all core component files.
- Used `typing.Any` as a placeholder for the `Device` object where needed.

**Next Steps:** Commit the changes.

**Phase:** Netmiko Driver Implementation (Phase 3 Start)

**Goal:** Implement the core device connection and command execution logic using Netmiko.

**Plan:**
- Implement `run_command` in `netraven/worker/backends/netmiko_driver.py`.
- Use `netmiko.ConnectHandler` to establish SSH connection.
- Execute `show running-config` command.
- Handle potential `NetmikoTimeoutException`, `NetmikoAuthenticationException`, and general `Exception`.
- Ensure device disconnection in a `finally` block.
- Assume device object provides `device_type`, `ip_address`, `username`, `password` attributes.
- Add necessary imports.
- Note `netmiko` dependency requirement.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Implemented `run_command` function with Netmiko logic.
- Added imports for `ConnectHandler` and specific exceptions.
- Included basic error handling and logging (print statements for now).
- Added placeholder `device` attribute access.
- Included commented-out example usage block for potential local testing.

**Next Steps:** Commit the changes.

**Phase:** Redaction Utility Implementation & Testing (Phase 4 Start)

**Goal:** Implement and test the utility for redacting sensitive information from device output.

**Plan:**
- Implement the `redact` function in `netraven/worker/redactor.py`.
- Use a predefined list of keywords (e.g., "password", "secret", case-insensitive).
- Replace lines containing keywords with `[REDACTED LINE]`.
- Create unit tests in `tests/worker/test_redactor.py`.
- Use `pytest` for testing.
- Cover various scenarios (keywords present, absent, case variations, empty input).
- Commit implementation and tests.

**Progress:**
- Implemented the `redact` function as specified.
- Created the `tests/worker/` directory and `test_redactor.py` file.
- Added comprehensive unit tests using `pytest.mark.parametrize` to cover multiple input cases.

**Next Steps:** Commit the changes.

**Phase:** Logging Utilities Implementation (Phase 5 Start)

**Goal:** Implement functions to save connection and job logs to the database.

**Plan:**
- Implement `save_connection_log` and `save_job_log` in `netraven/worker/log_utils.py`.
- Use the `get_db` session manager pattern from `postgresql_sot.md`.
- Assume existence of `ConnectionLog` and `JobLog` database models (from `netraven.db.models`).
- Add placeholder imports/checks for models/session as they might not be implemented yet.
- Instantiate model objects with provided data.
- Add, commit, and close the database session.
- Include basic try/except/finally blocks with rollback for error handling.
- Add temporary print statements for logging activity.
- Commit changes.

**Progress:**
- Implemented `save_connection_log` and `save_job_log` functions.
- Added necessary imports (placeholder for models, actual for `get_db`).
- Included logic for session management, model instantiation, commit, rollback, and closing.
- Added placeholder checks and print statements.

**Next Steps:** Commit the changes.
