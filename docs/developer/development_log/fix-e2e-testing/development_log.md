# Development Log: fix/e2e-testing

**Date:** 2025-04-10

**Developer:** Xavier

**Branch:** fix/e2e-testing

**Goal:** Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the NetRaven application, identify and fix issues, and ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Plan

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Ensure all required services are running (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Verify development environment is properly configured
   - Create test data for different scenarios

2. **Component Testing**
   - Test API endpoints with real requests
   - Test Scheduler functionality with real jobs
   - Test Worker communication with mock devices
   - Test Frontend UI functionality

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test full workflow: Create device → Schedule job → Run job → View results
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test concurrent job execution

4. **Issue Tracking and Resolution**
   - Document all issues found
   - Implement fixes on this branch
   - Verify fixes with regression testing

## Progress

### Setup Phase (Complete)

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Started by checking the current status of the project and creating this development log. The next step is to verify that all required services are properly set up and running.

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Created a comprehensive service startup script to easily start and stop all NetRaven services:

1. **Startup Script Features:**
   - Automatically starts PostgreSQL and Redis if not running
   - Creates a default admin user with password 'admin123'
   - Starts API service, Scheduler service, and Frontend development server
   - Provides colorful console output with status information
   - Records PIDs and manages log files
   - Creates a complementary stop script

2. **Default Admin User:**
   - The script creates a default admin user (if it doesn't exist) with:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123
     - Role: admin

3. **Script Location:**
   - `/home/netops/Projects2025/python/netraven/setup/start_netraven.sh`
   - Accompanying stop script: `/home/netops/Projects2025/python/netraven/setup/stop_netraven.sh`

This script will significantly simplify testing by ensuring a consistent environment and making it easy to start and stop services.

Encountered several issues when running the startup script. Fixed these issues to ensure smooth startup:

1. **User Model Missing:**
   - Problem: The `User` model was missing from the database models.
   - Solution: Created `/netraven/db/models/user.py` with the proper User class definition.
   - Added the User model to the imports in `/netraven/db/models/__init__.py`.
   - Generated and applied an Alembic migration to add the User table to the database.

2. **Schema Imports Issue:**
   - Problem: Encountered `AttributeError: module 'netraven.api.schemas' has no attribute 'device'`.
   - Solution: Updated `/netraven/api/schemas/__init__.py` to import all the schema modules.

3. **Incorrect Model Import in Auth Router:**
   - Problem: `auth_router.py` had incorrect import: `from netraven.api import models`.
   - Solution: Changed the import to `from netraven.db.models import User` and updated related code.

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Successfully started all NetRaven services:
- API service is running at http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- Scheduler service is running in the background
- Frontend development server is running at http://localhost:5173

The setup phase is now complete. All services are running properly and can be accessed for testing.

### Frontend Fixes

**Date:** 2025-04-10

While navigating to the frontend, encountered errors loading the pages due to missing dependencies:

1. **Missing Heroicons Package:**
   - Problem: Frontend Vue components were trying to import icons from '@heroicons/vue/24/outline' but the package wasn't installed.
   - Error: `Failed to resolve import "@heroicons/vue/24/outline" from "src/pages/Jobs.vue"`
   - Solution: Installed the missing package with `npm install @heroicons/vue`

This fix allows the frontend pages to load correctly without 500 errors.

### Component Testing: API Endpoints (Starting)

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Now that all services are running, we'll begin testing the API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly. The plan is to:

1. **Authentication Testing:**
   - Test login with the default admin user credentials
   - Verify that JWT tokens are generated properly
   - Test protected endpoints with and without tokens

2. **Device Management Testing:**
   - Create test devices via API
   - List, retrieve, update, and delete devices
   - Test tag association with devices

3. **Job Management Testing:**
   - Create test jobs via API
   - List, retrieve, update, and delete jobs
   - Test tag association with jobs
   - Test job execution via the "run now" endpoint

4. **User Management Testing:**
   - Create new test users with different roles
   - Test access control based on user roles
   - Test user activation/deactivation

Next step: Begin authentication testing to ensure we can properly access the protected endpoints.
