# Development Log: fix/e2e-testing

**Date:** 2025-04-10

**Developer:** Xavier

**Branch:** fix/e2e-testing

**Goal:** Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of the NetRaven application, identify and fix issues, and ensure all components work together seamlessly.

## Plan

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Ensure all required services are running (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Verify development environment is properly configured
   - Create test data for different scenarios

2. **Component Testing**
   - Test API endpoints with real requests
   - Test Scheduler functionality with real jobs
   - Test Worker communication with mock devices
   - Test Frontend UI functionality

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test full workflow: Create device → Schedule job → Run job → View results
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Test concurrent job execution

4. **Issue Tracking and Resolution**
   - Document all issues found
   - Implement fixes on this branch
   - Verify fixes with regression testing

## Progress

### Setup Phase (In Progress)

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Started by checking the current status of the project and creating this development log. The next step is to verify that all required services are properly set up and running.

**Date:** 2025-04-10

Created a comprehensive service startup script to easily start and stop all NetRaven services:

1. **Startup Script Features:**
   - Automatically starts PostgreSQL and Redis if not running
   - Creates a default admin user with password 'admin123'
   - Starts API service, Scheduler service, and Frontend development server
   - Provides colorful console output with status information
   - Records PIDs and manages log files
   - Creates a complementary stop script

2. **Default Admin User:**
   - The script creates a default admin user (if it doesn't exist) with:
     - Username: admin
     - Password: admin123
     - Role: admin

3. **Script Location:**
   - `/home/netops/Projects2025/python/netraven/setup/start_netraven.sh`
   - Accompanying stop script: `/home/netops/Projects2025/python/netraven/setup/stop_netraven.sh`

This script will significantly simplify testing by ensuring a consistent environment and making it easy to start and stop services.

Next steps:
- Test the startup script to verify it works correctly
- Begin component-level testing of the API endpoints
