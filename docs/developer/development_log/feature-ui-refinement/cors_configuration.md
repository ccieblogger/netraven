# UI Refinement: CORS Configuration

## Overview
Added CORS credentials support to the frontend API service to enable proper cross-origin requests with authentication.

## Changes Made
- Added `withCredentials: true` to the Axios configuration in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
- This ensures cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates are properly sent with cross-origin requests
- The change aligns with the backend's CORS middleware which has `allow_credentials=True` configured

## Commit Information
- Branch: feature-ui-refinement
- Commit: "Add withCredentials to frontend API service for proper CORS support"

## Testing Notes
- The application was tested locally with frontend running on port 5177
- Verified CORS requests are working correctly with credentials

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any CORS-related issues
- If issues persist, may need to check backend CORS configuration in `netraven/api/main.py`
