### Phase 3.1: DiffViewer Component Implementation (2025-04-11)

**Review:**

After reviewing the codebase, I've found that several frontend components have been implemented, including:
- Base components: BaseModal, BaseTable, FormField
- Selection components: TagSelector, CredentialSelector
- CRUD form components: DeviceFormModal, JobFormModal
- Pagination and filtering components

However, the DiffViewer component for configuration visualization is missing, and there's no implementation for real-time job status updates.

**Plan for today:**

1. Create the DiffViewer component to display configuration differences between job runs
2. Implement real-time job status update functionality
3. Add any missing CRUD functionality in device and job forms

**Implementation Details:**

The DiffViewer component will:
- Use Diff2Html library as specified in the frontend SOT
- Display configuration differences in a Git-style format
- Support side-by-side and unified diff views
- Include header information showing the compared versions
- Allow navigation between different configurations

The real-time job status functionality will:
- Implement polling or WebSocket connection to check job status
- Display progress indicators for running jobs
- Update UI components when job status changes
- Show detailed device-level status during job execution

### Phase 3.2: DiffViewer Implementation (2025-04-12)

### Phase 4.1: Worker Service Error Handling Enhancements (2025-04-15)

**Implemented structured error handling for device communication:**

After reviewing the worker service code, I've enhanced the error handling and retry mechanisms to improve reliability and make the error reporting more structured and useful. The following implementations were completed:

1. **Structured Error Classification:**
   - Created a new `error_handler.py` module with an extensible error classification system
   - Implemented `ErrorCategory` enum to categorize different types of errors:
     - Connection errors (authentication, timeout, connection refused)
     - Command execution errors (syntax, rejection, timeout)
     - Device state errors (busy, privilege level)
     - General errors (Git, unknown errors)
   - Created `ErrorInfo` class to store detailed error information, including:
     - Error category, message, original exception
     - Retry information (count, max retries, is_retriable)
     - Context data for diagnostics
     - Functions for determining retry strategies
   - Added utility functions for classifying exceptions and formatting errors for logging

2. **Improved Retry Logic:**
   - Moved retry logic from the executor to the dispatcher for cleaner separation of concerns
   - Implemented exponential backoff for retriable errors
   - Added specific retry policies for different error types:
     - Authentication failures: no retry (credentials won't suddenly change)
     - Timeouts: retry with backoff (might be temporary network issues)
     - Command timeouts: retry with backoff (device might be busy)
     - Git failures: limited retries (might be temporary file system issues)
   - Added detailed retry logging for better visibility into retry attempts

3. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Improved logging throughout the worker service
   - Added timing information for connection attempts
   - Implemented detailed context in log messages (job ID, device name/ID)
   - Added structured error logs with classified error information
   - Integrated with existing job and connection log database storage

4. **Configuration Parameters:**
   - Added support for timeouts in Netmiko driver:
     - Connection timeout: Time allowed for establishing connection
     - Command timeout: Time allowed for command execution
   - Made retry parameters configurable:
     - Max retry attempts: Number of retries to attempt
     - Retry backoff: Initial delay between retries (doubled for each subsequent attempt)

5. **Device Communication Improvements:**
   - Enhanced Netmiko driver with better error reporting
   - Added validation for command output
   - Implemented proper resource cleanup in error cases
   - Added performance metrics (execution time) for device operations

These enhancements make the worker service more robust against temporary failures and provide better diagnostics when errors occur. The system now handles transient errors gracefully with automatic retries while permanent errors (like authentication failures) are reported clearly without unnecessary delay from futile retry attempts.

Next steps include:
1. Writing comprehensive tests for the error handling system
2. Extending error retry policies based on real-world scenarios
3. Adding circuit breaker patterns to avoid overwhelming failing devices
4. Implementing device capability detection to adapt command execution

### Bugfix: Standardize Log Type Values (2025-04-11)

**Standardized log type values between frontend and backend:**

1. **Issue Identified:**
   - Log filtering wasn't working correctly due to a mismatch in log type values
   - Frontend was using `'job'` and `'connection'` while backend expected `'job_log'` and `'connection_log'`

2. **Fix Implemented:**
   - Updated the frontend log type filter options in `Logs.vue` to use consistent values:
     - Changed `'job'` to `'job_log'`
     - Changed `'connection'` to `'connection_log'`
   - This ensures the backend correctly applies the log type filter

3. **Benefits:**
   - Consistent naming convention across the application
   - Fixed log filtering functionality
   - Improved maintainability by following API naming standards
