## Progress

### Phase 1.1: Pagination and Filtering for API Endpoints (2025-04-09)

**Implemented pagination and filtering for all resource listing endpoints:**

1. **Schema Changes:**
   - Created a `PaginationParams` base schema with `page` and `size` fields
   - Implemented a generic `PaginatedResponse` schema using Pydantic generics
   - Added a utility function `create_paginated_response` to generate paginated response models for each resource type
   - Created paginated response models for all resources: `Device`, `Job`, `Tag`, `Credential`, `User`, and combined `JobLog` and `ConnectionLog`

2. **API Endpoint Changes:**
   - Updated all listing endpoints (`GET /devices/`, `/jobs/`, `/tags/`, `/credentials/`, `/users/`, `/logs/`) to:
     - Accept pagination parameters (`page`, `size`)
     - Return paginated responses with metadata (`total`, `pages`, etc.)
     - Support filtering on common attributes specific to each resource type
     - Use improved SQL queries to optimize database performance

3. **Resource-Specific Filters:**
   - **Devices**: Added filtering by hostname, IP address, device type, and tag IDs
   - **Jobs**: Added filtering by name, status, is_enabled, schedule_type, and tag IDs
   - **Tags**: Added filtering by name and type
   - **Credentials**: Added filtering by username, priority, and tag IDs
   - **Users**: Added filtering by username, role, and is_active
   - **Logs**: Added filtering by job_id, device_id, log_type, and level

4. **Query Optimizations:**
   - Used SQLAlchemy efficiently for complex filtering with multiple conditions
