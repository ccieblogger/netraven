# NetRaven API Service Containerization Development Log

## Overview

This development log documents the process of containerizing the NetRaven API service. The goal is to migrate the existing FastAPI-based API service into a properly containerized microservice architecture, consistent with the other services in the NetRaven platform.

## Initial Analysis and Plan - Date: [Current Date]

After thoroughly reviewing the NetRaven codebase, I have developed the following plan for containerizing the API service.

### Current Architecture Understanding

The NetRaven API service is a FastAPI-based application with the following key characteristics:
- Built on Python 3.10+ and FastAPI framework
- Uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions with PostgreSQL
- Integrates with Redis for job queuing via RQ
- JWT-based authentication
- Requires connections to PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Currently run using uvicorn directly: `poetry run uvicorn netraven.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`

### Containerization Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Docker Configuration Setup

1. **Create API Dockerfile**
   - Base on Python 3.10+ Alpine or Slim image
   - Install Poetry and project dependencies
   - Configure proper working directory and entrypoint
   - Expose the appropriate port (8000)

2. **Update Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Add API service to existing docker-compose.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml
   - Configure proper networking between services (API, PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Define environment variables for database connections, Redis, etc.
   - Setup healthchecks for the API service
   - Define proper volumes for persistent data

#### Phase 2: Configuration Management

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Create .env files for development and production environments
   - Setup proper configuration passing to the containerized service
   - Ensure the API service can read configurations from environment variables

2. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Ensure proper configuration for database access within the container network
   - Update connection URLs to use service names instead of localhost

#### Phase 3: Container Build and Test

1. **Build and Test Container**
   - Implement container build and test workflows
   - Verify API endpoints functionality
   - Test interaction with PostgreSQL and Redis services
   - Validate authentication flows

2. **Healthcheck Implementation**
   - Add proper healthcheck mechanisms
   - Configure liveness and readiness probes

#### Phase 4: Documentation and Integration

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README and deployment instructions
   - Document container usage and configuration options

2. **Integrate with Existing Services**
   - Ensure other services can properly communicate with the containerized API
   - Test end-to-end workflows

### Key Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the containerized API service maintains optimal performance.

2. **Security**: Properly securing the containerized API service, especially regarding authentication and environment variables.

3. **Resource Management**: Configuring appropriate resource limits for the container.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Setting up proper logging and monitoring for the containerized service.

5. **Scalability**: Ensuring the containerized architecture can scale horizontally if needed.

### Timeline

- Phase 1 (Docker Configuration): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Configuration Management): 1 day
- Phase 3 (Container Build and Test): 1-2 days
- Phase 4 (Documentation and Integration): 1 day

Total estimated time: 4-6 days

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Docker Configuration Setup - Completed

1. **Created API Dockerfiles**
   - Created `docker/api/Dockerfile.dev` for development environment
   - Created `docker/api/Dockerfile.prod` for production environment
   - Configured Poetry for dependency management
   - Set up healthchecks and proper port exposure

2. **Updated Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Added API service to `docker-compose.yml` for development
   - Added API service to `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production
   - Configured networking between services
   - Set up environment variables and health checks

### Phase 2: Configuration Management - Completed

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**
   - Created `.env.dev` for development environment settings
   - Created `.env.prod` for production environment settings
   - Updated configuration loading in the API service to use environment variables

2. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Updated database connection URLs to use service names in containers
   - Ensured Redis connection works within the container network

3. **Enhanced API Service Configuration**
   - Updated `netraven/api/auth.py` to use configuration from config loader
   - Created `netraven/config/environments/prod.yaml` for production settings
   - Updated `netraven/api/main.py` to add proper CORS configuration for containerized environments

### Phase 3: Container Build and Test - Completed

1. **Build Tools**
   - Created `setup/build_api_container.sh` script to simplify building and running the API container
   - Added options for development vs. production environments

2. **Testing Procedures**
   - Built and tested the API container in development mode
   - Verified connectivity to PostgreSQL and Redis services
   - Tested API endpoint functionality
   - Validated authentication flows
   - Verified health check endpoints

### Phase 4: Documentation and Integration - Completed

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README with instructions for containerized deployment
   - Added containerized deployment section with usage examples
   - Documented environment configuration options

2. **Service Integration**
   - Updated CORS settings to allow communication between containerized services
   - Verified communication between frontend and API containers
   - Ensured proper interaction with PostgreSQL and Redis containers

## Test Instructions

### Basic Container Testing

1. **Build and Start the API Container**:
   ```bash
   ./setup/build_api_container.sh
   ```

2. **Check Container Status**:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   Verify that `netraven-api-dev` is running and healthy.

3. **Test Health Check Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   ```
   Expected response: `{"status":"ok"}`

4. **Access API Documentation**:
   Open a browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`
   Verify that the Swagger UI loads correctly.

### Authentication Testing

1. **Create a Test User** (if none exists):
   ```bash
   # TODO: Add user creation script if needed
   ```

2. **Test JWT Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Get token using curl
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "username=admin&password=admin123"
   ```
   Verify that you receive a JWT token in the response.

### Integration Testing

1. **Start All Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access Frontend and Verify API Communication**:
   Open a browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5173`
   Log in and verify that the frontend can communicate with the API.

## Conclusion

The API service has been successfully containerized and integrated with the existing NetRaven microservice architecture. The containerization process included:

1. Creating Docker configurations for both development and production environments
2. Setting up proper environment variable configurations
3. Ensuring proper communication between services
4. Updating documentation and providing testing procedures

The containerized API service provides the following benefits:
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Simplified deployment process
- Better isolation from the host system
- Improved scalability and portability

The migration to a containerized architecture aligns with the project's principles of simplicity, maintainability, and proper resource management.
