# Development Log: issue/14-dedup-device-creds

**Date:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Developer:** Nova (AI Assistant)

**Branch:** issue/14-dedup-device-creds

**Goal:** Fix duplicate device credentials in `/api/devices/{id}/credentials` API response (GitHub issue #14).

---

## Initial Analysis
- Reviewed issue #14 and confirmed the problem: duplicate credentials are returned for some devices.
- Located the endpoint and service logic responsible (`get_matching_credentials_for_device`).
- Identified that deduplication may not be enforced at the Python/object level, only at the SQL query level.
- Confirmed that tests do not explicitly check for duplicate credentials in the API response.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add a test to reproduce the bug (device with multiple tags, credential linked to multiple tags).
2. Refactor backend logic to deduplicate credentials by ID.
3. Update/add tests to cover all relevant cases.
4. Document all progress and results here and in GitHub issue #14.

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 1: Add a failing test to confirm the bug.

## Phase 1 Result: Test for Deduplication

- Added a comprehensive API test that creates a device with two tags and a credential linked to both tags.
- The test authenticates as an admin user, creates all resources via the API, and checks that only one credential is returned for the device.
- **Result:** The test PASSED. The API endpoint `/devices/{id}/credentials` does NOT return duplicate credentials, even when a credential matches multiple tags on the device.
- This suggests the deduplication bug is not present in the current codebase.

## Recommendation
- Unless further edge cases are found in production, this issue can be closed.
- If duplicates are observed in other environments, further investigation may be needed (e.g., DB state, migrations, or environment-specific issues).
