## Issue 1: Parameter Mismatch in `commit_git_side_effect` Function

**Date:** 2023-04-09

### Problem Description
The test suite was failing in `test_run_job_success_multiple_devices` due to a parameter mismatch in the mock function `commit_git_side_effect`. The function incorrectly included a `device_hostname` parameter which does not exist in the actual `git_writer.commit_configuration_to_git` function signature.

### Root Cause
The mock function signature was:
```python
def commit_git_side_effect(device_id, device_hostname, config_data, job_id, repo_path):
```

But the actual function signature is:
```python
def commit_configuration_to_git(device_id, config_data, job_id, repo_path):
```

The test was attempting to mock a function with an incorrect parameter list, causing the mock to not match the actual function calls during test execution.

### Solution
Modified the test by removing the `device_hostname` parameter from the mock function signature:

```python
# Changed from:
# def commit_git_side_effect(device_id, device_hostname, config_data, job_id, repo_path):

# To:
def commit_git_side_effect(device_id, config_data, job_id, repo_path):
```

### Verification
After applying the fix, all tests in the suite are now passing successfully:
- `test_run_job_success_multiple_devices`
- `test_run_job_partial_failure_multiple_devices`
- `test_run_job_total_failure_multiple_devices`
- `test_run_job_no_devices_found_via_tags`

### Additional Notes
- The mock function was catching all calls properly after fixing the parameter list
- The mismatch was likely introduced during a refactoring where the actual function signature was changed, but the test mock wasn't updated accordingly
