# NetRaven Container Communication Fix - Development Log

## Initial Analysis (2023-06-14)

Today I performed a comprehensive analysis of the NetRaven containerized services to identify communication issues between them. The main problems identified were:

1. Hard-coded API URL in the frontend service
2. Improper environment variable configuration
3. Incorrect network configuration for container-to-container communication
4. Missing API proxy in the Nginx configuration

I've created a detailed implementation plan that outlines the steps needed to fix these issues, which can be found in `implementation_plan.md` in this directory.

## Next Steps

After receiving approval on the implementation plan, I will proceed with:

1. Updating the frontend API service configuration to properly use environment variables
2. Updating Docker Compose files to include proper environment variables
3. Adding API proxy settings to the Nginx configuration
4. Testing the changes to ensure proper communication between services

## Reference Materials

During my research, I found the following best practices for container microservices communication:

1. Use service names instead of localhost for inter-container communication
2. Implement proper environment variable configuration for different environments
3. Configure API gateways for streamlined communication
4. Ensure CORS settings allow connections from all relevant origins
5. Leverage Docker networking for service discovery
