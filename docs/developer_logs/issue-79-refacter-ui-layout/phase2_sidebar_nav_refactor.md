# Phase 2: Sidebar and Navigation Refactor (Issue 79)

## Summary of Changes
- Refactored the sidebar navigation in `DefaultLayout.vue` to match the order and structure specified in the wireframes and UI spec.
- Added the missing `/status` (System Status) route to the sidebar navigation.
- Ensured all main routes are present and accessible from the sidebar: Dashboard, Jobs, Devices, Tags, Credentials, Users, Backups, Config Diff, Logs, System Status.
- Removed unused or legacy navigation items.
- Updated navigation order and icons for consistency with the spec.
- Did not change theming or responsiveness in this phase.

## Next
- Manual verification of navigation and active highlighting.
- Awaiting approval to proceed to topbar review and further layout refinements, or to move to Phase 3 (Theming & Tailwind Configuration).
