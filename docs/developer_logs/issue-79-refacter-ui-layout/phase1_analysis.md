# Phase 1 Analysis: Layout, Navigation, and Theming (Issue 79)

## 1. Requirements from Spec & Wireframes
- **Sidebar/Topbar:** Sidebar navigation with icons, all main routes accessible, active highlighting, logo at top, user/account at bottom.
- **Routes:** Dashboard, Jobs, Devices, Tags, Credentials, Users, Config Diff, Logs (Job/Connection), System Status.
- **Theming:** Dark theme default, Tailwind config per spec, WCAG-AA colors, responsive (â‰¤768px).
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA, color contrast.
- **References:** `/docs/ui-ux/NetRaven_UI_Wireframes.md` and `/docs/ui-ux/NetRaven_UI_Spec.md` (sections 2, 5, 7).

## 2. Current Implementation (from `DefaultLayout.vue` and `router/index.js`)
- **Sidebar:** Exists, with logo, navigation, user/account, and theme switcher.
- **Navigation Items:** Dashboard, Devices, Tags, Credentials, Jobs, Config Diff, Connection Logs, Job Logs, Users.
- **Topbar:** Simple header with system clock and notification bell.
- **Routes:** All major routes are present and protected by auth/role guards.
- **Theming:** Uses Tailwind classes, dark theme appears to be default, theme switcher present.
- **Responsiveness:** Layout uses flex and Tailwind, but mobile breakpoint handling needs review.
- **Accessibility:** Some focus/hover states, but ARIA/keyboard navigation not fully verified.

## 3. Gaps & Observations
- **Route Coverage:** All main routes from the spec are present, but `/status` (System Status) is missing from navigation.
- **Sidebar/Topbar Structure:** Sidebar structure is close to spec, but topbar is minimal (no navigation in topbar).
- **Active Highlighting:** Implemented via `$route.path.startsWith(item.path)`.
- **Theming:** Color classes are used, but palette and contrast need to be checked against spec.
- **Responsiveness:** No explicit mobile sidebar collapse/expand logic observed.
- **Accessibility:** No ARIA attributes or explicit keyboard navigation in sidebar/topbar.
