# Phase 3: Theming & Tailwind Configuration Audit (Issue 79)

## 1. Color Palette & Theming
- The current color palette is defined in `theme.scss` using CSS variables and mapped in `tailwind.config.js`.
- The dark theme is default, with light and blue themes available.
- All major UI elements use the palette via Tailwind classes or CSS variables.
- No stray default Tailwind colors found in the main styles.

## 2. Accessibility (Contrast) Check
- All key text/background color combinations (white/gray on dark blue) were checked.
- All elements meet or exceed WCAG-AA contrast requirements.
- No changes needed for accessibility.

## 3. Responsive (Mobile) Check
- Sidebar, topbar, and content layout were reviewed at â‰¤768px.
- Layout remains usable and visually consistent at mobile breakpoints.
- No major issues found; sidebar remains accessible, and content stacks appropriately.

## 4. Dependencies
- Tailwind, @tailwindcss/forms, and other modern tooling are present and up to date.

## Conclusion
- The current theming, palette, and responsive configuration meet the spec and accessibility requirements.
- No changes required in this phase.

## Next
- Awaiting approval to close out Issue 79 or proceed with any final polish as requested.
