# Phase 2b: Topbar and Layout Refinement (Issue 79)

## Summary of Changes
- Refactored the topbar to display the contextual page title dynamically based on the current route.
- Added simple breadcrumbs to the topbar for navigation context, per the spec and wireframes.
- Kept the system clock visible in the topbar, relocated to the right for clarity and alignment with the spec.
- Retained the notification bell in the topbar.
- Removed redundant page titles from the main content area (now only in the topbar).
- Ensured section headers and spacing in the main content area match the wireframes.
- No theming or responsiveness changes were made in this phase.

## Next
- Manual verification of topbar and layout across all main routes.
- Awaiting approval to proceed to Phase 3 (Theming & Tailwind Configuration).
