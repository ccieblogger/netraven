# Phase 2: Notification Integration for Credential Deletion (Issue #32)

## Summary
- Integrated the notification store and NotificationToast component into the Credentials page.
- Replaced all `alert()` calls in the delete logic with notification toasts for both errors and success.
- Users now receive clear, non-blocking feedback when credential deletion fails (e.g., due to permissions, network, or system credential restrictions) or succeeds.

## What Changed
- Imported and used `useNotificationStore` in `frontend/src/pages/Credentials.vue`.
- Updated `confirmDelete` to:
  - Show error toast if trying to delete a system credential.
  - Show error toast if deletion fails (e.g., unauthorized, forbidden, network error).
  - Show success toast if deletion succeeds.

## Why
- Improves user experience by providing clear, consistent, and non-intrusive feedback.
- Ensures error states are visible and actionable, rather than hidden in browser alerts.
- Aligns with project UI/UX standards and notification patterns.

## Next Steps
- Test the UI in various error and success scenarios.
- Update the GitHub issue with progress and screenshots if needed.
