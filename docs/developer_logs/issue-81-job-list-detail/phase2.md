# Developer Log — issue/81-job-list-detail — Phase 2

**Date:** 2025-04-27

## Summary
- Refactored `frontend/src/pages/Jobs.vue` to align with NetRaven UI wireframes and spec for the jobs list view.
- Filter bar is now inline, compact, and search is right-aligned.
- Table columns: ID, Type, Devices, Status (with icon), Duration, and a single 'Monitor' action.
- Status uses pill badges and correct icons for each state.
- All filters (type, status, date, search) are functional and visually consistent.
- Table is responsive and accessible.

## Technical Notes
- Used Tailwind utility classes for compact, responsive layout.
- Status badge helper function added for consistent color/icon mapping.
- Only the 'Monitor' action is shown in the table row, per wireframe.
- No log streaming or artifacts in this view (reserved for detail page).

## Next Steps
- Test the new UI for usability and accessibility.
- Proceed to Phase 3: Job Detail/Monitor refactor, LiveLog, and Artifacts section.
