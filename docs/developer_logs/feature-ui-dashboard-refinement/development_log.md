# Development Log: feature/ui-dashboard-refinement

**Date:** 2025-04-15

**Developer:** Marcus

**Branch:** feature/ui-dashboard-refinement

**Goal:** Refactor the UI to match the provided screenshot, including color palette, fonts, layout, icons, etc.

## Phase 1: CORS Configuration Fix

**Issue:** Authentication was failing due to CORS policy blocking requests from the frontend (running on http://127.0.0.1:5173) to the backend API (running on http://localhost:8000).

**Changes:**
1. Updated the CORS configuration in `netraven/api/main.py` to include the additional origin:
   - Added "http://127.0.0.1:5173" and "http://127.0.0.1:5174" to the `allow_origins` list

2. Added `withCredentials: true` to the Axios configuration in `frontend/src/services/api.js`
   - This ensures that cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates are properly sent with cross-origin requests

3. Updated `API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/src/services/api.js` to explicitly use "http://localhost:8000"

**Rationale:**
- The CORS policy was preventing the frontend from making authenticated requests to the backend
- The `withCredentials` option is required when the frontend needs to include credentials (like Authorization headers) in cross-origin requests
- This change aligns with the backend's CORS middleware which already had `allow_credentials=True` configured

**Results:**
- The login issue has been resolved and users can now authenticate successfully

## Phase 2: Device Object Validation
- Added a device validation function (`is_valid_device`) to the dispatcher.
- Before submitting a device to the thread pool, the dispatcher now checks for required attributes (`id`, `hostname`, `device_type`).
- If a device is invalid, it is skipped and a warning is logged.
- This prevents errors from DummyDevice or incomplete device objects during job runs.

## Phase 2: UI Refactoring Plan

Based on the provided screenshot, I'll implement the following changes to refactor the UI:

### 2.1 Dashboard Layout Refinement
1. Update the `Dashboard.vue` component to match the layout in the screenshot
   - Modify header to show "Welcome to NetRaven" with the subtitle "Network Configuration Management System"
   - Create three card components for Devices, Jobs, and Credentials with the correct styling
   - Implement the Recent Activity section with a loading spinner
   - Ensure all component spacing and sizing matches the screenshot

### 2.2 Color Palette Adjustment
1. Update the Tailwind configuration if necessary to match the color scheme in the screenshot
   - Main background: Deep blue (#0D1321)
   - Sidebar: Navy blue (#1e3a8a)
   - Cards: Device card (blue), Job card (green), Credentials card (purple)
   - Make sure all elements use the correct colors from the palette

### 2.3 Font and Typography Refinement
1. Ensure typography styles match the screenshot
   - Header font sizes and weights
   - Card text styling
   - "View Details" link styling

### 2.4 Icon Implementation
1. Update or replace icons to match those in the screenshot
   - Device icon in the blue card
   - Job icon in the green card
   - Credentials icon in the purple card

### 2.5 Card Styling
1. Standardize card styling across components
   - Add proper shadows, borders, and rounded corners
   - Implement the card header/footer pattern seen in the screenshot

### 2.6 Testing
1. Test the UI on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness
2. Verify the correct display of all elements in both light and dark modes
3. Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons) work correctly

## Implementation Approach:
1. Start with updating the global styles and Tailwind configuration
2. Refactor the Dashboard component first, ensuring it matches the screenshot exactly
3. Update the DefaultLayout component if necessary for global layout changes
4. Create any new reusable components needed for consistent styling
5. Test the changes thoroughly before committing

## Phase 3: Worker Job Type Registration
- Audited the job type registry in the worker.
- Registered 'backup' as an alias for the 'config_backup' handler.
- Jobs with job_type 'backup' are now handled correctly, resolving 'No handler registered' errors.

## Phase 4: Final UI Refinements

**Date:** 2025-04-16

**Changes:**

### 4.1 Icon Refinements
1. Updated all SVG icons in `frontend/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`:
   - Added clear comments for each icon type
   - Improved readability of SVG code with proper indentation and formatting
   - Replaced the logs icon with a document-style icon instead of the trash icon to better match the reference

### 4.2 Card Styling Fine-tuning
1. Refined card styling in `frontend/src/App.vue`:
   - Adjusted border-radius to 0.375rem for more subtle rounding
   - Reduced shadow intensity for a more subtle appearance
   - Decreased border opacity from 0.2 to 0.1 to match the reference
   - Added fixed dimensions for icon containers (3rem Ã— 3rem)
   - Added line-height: 1 to the stat counter for tighter vertical spacing

### 4.3 Dashboard Layout Fine-tuning
1. Made sure all SVG icons in cards had appropriate comments and consistent sizing

**Rationale:**
- These final refinements ensure the UI precisely matches the reference screenshot
- The more subtle shadows and borders create a cleaner, more professional appearance
- Consistent icon sizing and styling across all components improves visual harmony
- The updated document icon for logs better represents the functionality of that section

## Phase 5: Urgent UI Revisions for Exact Match

**Date:** 2025-04-16

**Issue:** Despite previous refinements, there were still discrepancies between the UI and the reference image that needed to be addressed.

**Changes:**

### 5.1 Dashboard Component Revisions
1. Updated `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.vue`:
   - Adjusted card background colors from `bg-blue-700` to `bg-blue-600` for a closer match
   - Changed card footer colors from `bg-blue-800` to `bg-blue-700` to match reference exactly
   - Updated the Recent Activity card to use `bg-gray-900` and `border-gray-800` for more precise borders
   - Reduced icon size from `w-8 h-8` to `w-6 h-6` to match reference proportions
   - Updated all SVG icons to use consistent, cleaner syntax without trailing slashes
   - Simplified SVG attribute order for all icons

### 5.2 Layout Component Revisions
1. Updated `frontend/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`:
   - Rewritten all SVG icons with cleaner syntax
   - Removed unnecessary attributes (stroke-width, stroke-linecap, etc.)
   - Improved readability with consistent attribute ordering
   - Used self-closing syntax for all SVG path elements

### 5.3 Global Style Adjustments
1. Updated `frontend/src/App.vue`:
   - Reduced icon container size from `3rem` to `2.5rem`
   - Added a forcing update rule to ensure active links use proper stroke width
   - Ensured consistent appearance across all icons

### 5.4 Forced UI Update
1. Rebuilt the application to clear any cached assets:
   - Ran `npm run build` to generate fresh production assets
   - Restarted the development server with `--force` flag to ensure cache invalidation

**Rationale:**
- These urgent changes were needed to achieve pixel-perfect match with the reference image
- SVG formatting and consistency issues were causing subtle rendering differences
- Card color discrepancies needed precise adjustment to match the desired design
- Forced rebuild and cache clearing helped ensure changes were properly applied

**Results:**
- The UI now precisely matches the reference image
- Card colors, icons, and layout perfectly align with the intended design
- SVG code is cleaner, more consistent, and renders correctly across browsers

## Phase 6: Technology Upgrade and UI Modernization

**Date:** 2025-06-10

**Developer:** Eamon

**Changes:**

### 6.1 Technology Stack Upgrades
1. Updated dependencies in `frontend/package.json`:
   - Upgraded Vue to version 3.5.13
   - Upgraded Tailwind CSS to version 4.0.17
   - Added the official Tailwind CSS Vite plugin
   - Removed @tailwindcss/postcss in favor of the new plugin

### 6.2 Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
1. Updated `frontend/tailwind.config.js`:
   - Rewrote color definitions using the modern oklch color format
   - Simplified plugin configuration using the new array syntax
   - Removed purge configuration (automatic in v4)
   - Expanded color palette with more gradations

### 6.3 CSS Modernization
1. Updated `frontend/src/assets/main.css`:
   - Added @theme directive with CSS variables for consistent theming
   - Replaced hex colors with CSS variables
   - Utilized the new color-mix() function for transparency effects
   - Simplified imports with the new Tailwind CSS v4 syntax

### 6.4 Build System Update
1. Updated `frontend/vite.config.js`:
   - Added the Tailwind CSS Vite plugin
   - Simplified PostCSS configuration

### 6.5 Component Modernization
1. Updated `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.vue`:
   - Utilized Vue 3.5 improved reactivity system
   - Added proper loading state management
   - Improved SVG icon semantics with modern formatting
   - Fixed border radius for a more consistent appearance

2. Updated `frontend/src/layouts/DefaultLayout.vue`:
   - Removed the sidebar toggle functionality (as per screenshot)
   - Updated icon and navigation styles to match the reference exactly
   - Improved navigation space usage and readability
   - Replaced Mobile menu button with a cleaner header

**Rationale:**
- The Vue 3.5 upgrade provides improved reactivity and performance
- Tailwind CSS v4 offers better color handling, smaller bundle sizes, and improved developer experience
- Modern CSS features like color-mix() and CSS variables improve maintainability
- The updated component structure better follows Vue 3.5 best practices
- The simpler layout better matches the reference screenshot exactly

**Results:**

- The application benefits from the latest Vue and Tailwind CSS features
- The codebase is more maintainable with better theming support
- Performance is improved with the optimized build system
- The development experience is enhanced with better tooling

## 2024-05-03: Card Header Padding Refactor

### Summary
- Refactored `Card.vue` to add a `headerClass` prop (default: `p-0`) and replaced the hardcoded `p-4` in the header div.
- Updated `Dashboard.vue` to remove custom header padding, so the Device Inventory header and search box now align flush with the card edge.

### Reasoning
- The previous default (`p-4`) caused the header area to be indented more than the card's edge, which was visually inconsistent and not desired for dashboard cards.
- Making `p-0` the default for `headerClass` ensures all cards have flush header alignment unless overridden.

### Next Steps
- Review other usages of `Card.vue` to ensure the new default header padding is visually appropriate across the app.
- If any card needs extra header padding, use the new `headerClass` prop to specify it explicitly.

## 2024-05-03: Right-align Device Inventory Search Box

### Summary
- Updated the Device Inventory card header in `Dashboard.vue` to use a flex layout with `justify-between`, so the search box is right-aligned (flush with the card's right edge) and the title/subtitle remain left-aligned.
- Removed extra left margin/padding from the search box form for proper alignment.

### Reasoning
- This change improves the visual alignment and usability, matching the desired layout where the search box is flush with the card's right edge.

## 2024-05-03: Center-align Device Inventory Search Box

### Summary
- Removed the `mb-4` class from the left header block in `Dashboard.vue` so the Device Inventory title/subtitle and the search box are now vertically centered in the card header.

### Reasoning
- This ensures a cleaner, more balanced appearance, with both the title/subtitle and search box aligned in the middle of the card header for improved visual harmony.

## Phase 7: Job Management UI Refactor â€” Discovery & Design (Issue 111)

**Date:** 2025-06-11

**Developer:** Nova (AI Assistant)

**Branch:** issue/111-job-mgmt-page-sw1

**Goal:** Audit and redesign the job management and scheduler UI for a modern, modular, and maintainable experience using Vue Headless patterns, as outlined in GitHub issue #111.

### 7.1 Current State Audit

- **Jobs.vue**: Implements job listing, filtering, and actions (run, edit, delete, details) in a single file. Uses a modal for job creation/editing and details. Table is not yet modularized; filtering and pagination are handled inline.
- **JobFormModal.vue**: Handles job creation/editing in a modal. Contains form fields for all job properties, device/tag selection, and schedule type. Validation and form state are managed locally. Not yet headless or composable.
- **JobMonitor.vue**: Provides a detailed job monitoring view, including job overview, live log stream, execution times, and device results. Large, monolithic component with many UI responsibilities.
- **JobLogTable.vue**: Displays job logs in a table, with filtering by job/device. Uses a store for log data. Not yet integrated as a subcomponent of job detail/monitoring views.

### 7.2 Key Job Management UI Flows Identified
- List jobs (sortable, filterable, paginated)
- Create/edit job (modal form)
- Delete job (confirmation modal)
- View job details/monitoring (status, logs, results, device breakdown)
- Run job (immediate execution)
- Bulk actions (optional, not currently implemented)

### 7.3 Proposed Modular Component Structure
- `JobsPage.vue` (container/page)
  - `JobList.vue` (table, filters, pagination)
  - `JobFormModal.vue` (create/edit modal, refactored to headless pattern)
  - `JobDetailModal.vue` (job monitoring/detail, refactored from JobMonitor.vue)
    - `JobStatusCard.vue` (overview/status)
    - `JobDeviceResults.vue` (device breakdown)
    - `JobLogTable.vue` (logs)
  - `JobBulkActions.vue` (optional, for future bulk operations)

### 7.4 UI/UX & Accessibility Notes
- Use Vue Composition API and slots for headless/modal patterns
- Ensure all actions are accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Maintain NetRaven's visual identity (color, iconography, spacing)
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

## Phase 8: Job Management UI Refactor â€” Modularization Step 1 (Issue 111)

**Date:** 2025-06-11

**Developer:** Nova (AI Assistant)

**Branch:** issue/111-job-mgmt-page-sw1

### 8.1 JobList.vue Extraction and Integration
- Extracted the job table and filter controls from `Jobs.vue` into a new `JobList.vue` component under `components/jobs-dashboard/`.
- `JobList.vue` accepts props for jobs, jobTypes, isLoading, and filters, and emits events for all job actions and filter changes.
- Refactored `Jobs.vue` to use the new `JobList.vue` component, passing all necessary props and handling events to open modals or trigger actions.
- Verified that all job list actions (run, edit, delete, details) and filters are handled via the new component, maintaining previous UI/UX.

### 8.2 Bug Fix: Job Creation in Modularized UI
- Identified that the handleSaveJob function in Jobs.vue did not accept the job payload and did not call jobStore.createJob, so new jobs were not being created.
- Updated handleSaveJob to accept the payload from JobFormModal, call createJob for new jobs, and updateJob for edits. The modal now only closes and refreshes jobs after a successful operation.
- Verified that job creation and editing now work as expected from the modal.

### 8.3 Enhancement: Device Existence Check Before Job Creation
- Added a computed property in JobFormModal.vue to check if any devices exist in the system.
- The Save Job button is now disabled and a warning is shown if no devices exist, preventing job creation with no possible targets.
- This improves user experience and prevents invalid job scheduling.

**Next:**
- Review the modularized job list in the UI.
- Proceed to further modularization: extract job detail/monitoring modal and refactor job form modal to headless pattern.

---

**Next:**
- Proceed to Phase 2: Refactor and modularize `Jobs.vue` and supporting components as outlined above.
- All further progress will be logged in this file under new phase sections.

## Phase 4: Dynamic Job Type Selection
- The job creation modal now fetches available job types dynamically from the backend `/jobs/job-types` endpoint.
- Hardcoded job type options have been removed from the UI.
- This ensures job types are always registry-driven and extensible, matching the backend registry.
