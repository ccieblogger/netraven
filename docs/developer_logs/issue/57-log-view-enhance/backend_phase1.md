# Development Log: Backend Phase 1 â€“ Log View Enhancement (Issue #57)

## Date: [AUTOMATED ENTRY]

### Summary
- Began work on enhancement #57 for advanced job log view (backend-first).
- Analyzed current `/api/job-logs` endpoint, models, and schemas.
- Identified gaps: no keyword search, no filtering by job name/type, no multi-select for device names, and missing job/device names in response.

### Changes Made
1. **Schema Update**
   - Extended `JobLog` schema to include `job_name`, `device_name`, and `job_type` as optional fields for richer API responses.

2. **Endpoint Refactor**
   - Refactored `/api/job-logs` endpoint to support:
     - Filtering by job name, device names (multi-select), job type, and keyword search.
     - Joins with Job and Device tables to enrich response with job name, device name, and job type.
   - Added new endpoint `/api/job-logs/job-names` to return unique job names that have logs.
   - Confirmed that device names for dropdowns should be sourced from `/devices` and log levels are static (no new endpoints needed).

### Test Results
- All new job log API tests passed successfully in the container (`netraven-api-dev`).
- Tests covered filtering by job name, device names (multi-select), job type, keyword search, response enrichment, and the job-names endpoint.

### Next Steps
- Add/extend backend tests for new filtering/search logic and enriched responses.
- Update API documentation.
- Await frontend phase after backend is complete.

## Final Resolution (2025-04-23)
- Enhancement #57 completed. All backend and frontend issues resolved.
- Device filter now uses a single-select dropdown for scalability.
- API call for devices updated to `/devices/` (trailing slash) for backend compatibility.
- Filter logic improved to handle device_names as string or array.
- Confirmed `/job-logs/` endpoint performs real DB queries (no mock data).
- All changes and investigation steps logged in the GitHub issue and here.
