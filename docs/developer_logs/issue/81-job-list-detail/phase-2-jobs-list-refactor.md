# Phase 2: Jobs List Refactor (Issue 81)

## Date: [Auto-generated]

### Summary
- Begin refactor of `/pages/Jobs.vue` to match wireframes and UI spec for jobs list.
- Audit of existing filter and table components completed.
- Will use/adapt `ResourceFilter.vue` for the filter bar and refactor the jobs table to match columns, status icons, and actions per spec.
- Will ensure all changes maintain the existing site theme and color palette.

### Component Audit
- `ResourceFilter.vue` is a flexible, reusable filter bar.
- `JobsTableFilter.vue` only displays active filters, not a full filter bar.
- `JobsTable.vue` (dashboard) and `/pages/Jobs.vue` use different table logic; will refactor for consistency and reuse if possible.

### Next Steps
- Implement filter bar in `/pages/Jobs.vue` using `ResourceFilter.vue`.
- Refactor jobs table to match wireframe: columns (ID, Type, Devices, Status, Duration), status icons, and actions.
- Remove/update any columns/UI not present in the wireframe.
- Ensure all UI changes use the current theme and color palette.
- Log progress here and in GitHub issue 81 after each major change.

### Progress Log

- [Step 1] Added filter bar to `/pages/Jobs.vue` using `ResourceFilter.vue`.
  - Configured for Type, Status, Date, and Search fields per wireframe/spec.
  - Ensured styling and color palette match existing site theme.
  - Next: Implement filtering logic and refactor jobs table columns/layout.

- [Step 2] Implemented jobs filtering logic in `/pages/Jobs.vue`.
  - The jobs table now responds to Type, Status, Date, and Search filters.
  - Filtering is applied reactively using the Pinia job store.
  - Existing theme and color palette are preserved.
  - Next: Refactor jobs table columns and layout to match wireframe (ID, Type, Devices, Status with icons, Duration, Actions).

- [Step 3] Refactored jobs table in `/pages/Jobs.vue` to match wireframe.
  - Columns: ID, Type, Devices, Status (with icons), Duration, Actions.
  - Removed columns not present in the wireframe (Name, Description, Enabled, Schedule, Tags, Last Status).
  - Status column uses icons: ✅ for success, ❌ for failed, ⏳ for running/queued, neutral for others.
  - Devices column shows count.
  - Duration column uses formatted duration.
  - Theme and color palette preserved.
  - Next: Review and polish for consistency and accessibility.

- [Step 4] Updated sidebar navigation in DefaultLayout.vue to support nested Jobs menu.
  - Jobs is now a parent with 'List' (/jobs) and 'Dashboard' (/jobs-dashboard) sub-items.
  - Adjusted sidebar rendering logic for nested children.
  - Ensured all other items remain as per the UI spec.

- [Step 5] Fixed router configuration to explicitly add /jobs-dashboard route mapped to JobsDashboard.vue.
  - Now, clicking 'Dashboard' under Jobs in the sidebar loads the correct view.

### Remaining Work
- Review and polish sidebar and navigation for accessibility and UX consistency.
- Ensure all new sidebar routes (e.g., Backups, System Status) have corresponding pages or placeholders.
- Continue with any additional UI/UX refinements or feature requests as needed.
