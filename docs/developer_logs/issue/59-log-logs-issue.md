# Development Log: Issue 59 - Job Logs Not Written for Reachability Jobs

## Summary

- Root cause: Handler dispatch logic did not call the correct handler for reachability jobs, resulting in missing job logs.
- Solution: Refactored worker dispatch to use `JOB_TYPE_HANDLERS` registry. Added/fixed unit tests for reachability handler.
- All tests now pass in the containerized environment with correct `PYTHONPATH`.
- Issue is resolved and verified by automated tests.
- See [GitHub issue comment for closure](https://github.com/ccieblogger/netraven/issues/59#issuecomment-2825920113).
