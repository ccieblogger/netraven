# Developer Log — Issue 101: JobDashboard UI (Phase 1)

**Branch:** issue/101-jobdashboard-ui
**Phase:** 1 — UI/UX & Mock Data
**Date Started:** [TO FILL]

---

## Phase 1 Plan
- Scaffold `JobDashboard.vue` and subcomponents:
  - `JobSummaryCards.vue`
  - `JobRunsTable.vue`
  - `UnifiedLogsTable.vue`
  - `JobFiltersBar.vue`
- Implement layout and theming per spec (PrimeVue, Tailwind, project tokens).
- Set up Pinia stores for jobs/logs/auth with mock data.
- Ensure all filters, tabs, and summary cards update UI state from mock data.
- Document all changes in this log.

## Progress Log

- **[INIT]** Phase 1 started. Confirmed branch and requirements. Preparing to scaffold main and subcomponents with mock data and layout per spec.
- **[COMPONENTS]** Scaffolded and integrated all main and subcomponents for phase 1:
  - Refactored/extended JobsDashboard.vue to add summary cards, filters bar, and tabbed tables per spec (mock data only).
  - Created JobSummaryCards.vue, JobFiltersBar.vue, JobRunsTable.vue, UnifiedLogsTable.vue in components/jobs-dashboard/ (all use mock data, Tailwind/PrimeVue styling).
- **[BUGFIX]** Fixed missing TabPanel import in JobsDashboard.vue (PrimeVue). This resolves the '[Vue warn]: Failed to resolve component: TabPanel' error and allows tabs and datatables to render as expected. Verified in browser; UI now matches phase 1 requirements.
- **[UI POLISH]** Removed test TabView section from JobsDashboard.vue. Refactored JobRunsTable and UnifiedLogsTable to use 'nr-card' wrapper, project-standard table classes, and text color theming. All dashboard tables now match the look and feel of Dashboard.vue.
- **[VISUAL CONSISTENCY]** Updated JobRunsTable and UnifiedLogsTable to use border-divider for row lines, strong border only under header, and text-text-primary/font-semibold for header. All horizontal lines and font weights now visually match Dashboard.vue device table.
