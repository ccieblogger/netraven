# Phase 3 Development Log: Device Inventory Table Redesign

**Date:** [auto-fill]
**Branch:** issue/98-refactor-device-tble

## Summary
- Refactored `DeviceTable.vue` to add a filter row (`filterDisplay="row"`) and per-column filters for hostname, IP, serial, and job status.
- Added a `filters` prop to `DeviceTable.vue` to allow parent components to control table filtering (matching the logs datatable pattern).
- Updated table columns to include filter templates and consistent styling.
- Ensured the table is visually and functionally consistent with the logs datatable, supporting per-column and global filtering.
- Removed any obsolete custom filtering logic from the table component.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/DeviceTable.vue`

## Next Steps
- Update `Dashboard.vue` to manage and pass the `filters` object to `DeviceTable.vue`.
- Test the new table for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
- Commit changes after successful testing.
