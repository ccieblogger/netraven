# Phase 2 Development Log: Device Inventory Card Refactor

**Date:** [auto-fill]
**Branch:** issue/98-refactor-device-tble

## Summary
- Refactored the Device Inventory card on the Dashboard to remove all filter elements except the search box.
- The search box is now a general-purpose search for device inventory (hostname, IP, etc.).
- Removed tag filtering, filter reset, and all related legacy logic from both the template and script sections of `Dashboard.vue`.
- Updated the device filtering logic to use only the search box.
- UI is now cleaner and simpler, in line with the requirements of issue #98.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.vue`

## Next Steps
- Redesign the device inventory table to match the logs datatable (Phase 3).
