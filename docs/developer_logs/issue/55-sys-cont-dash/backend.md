# Backend Development Log: System Status Endpoint

## Summary
Implemented a new `/system/status` endpoint in the FastAPI backend to provide real-time health status for core NetRaven services (API, PostgreSQL, Redis, Worker, Scheduler). This endpoint supports 30-second result caching and a manual refresh option via the `?refresh=true` query parameter.

## Implementation Details
- **Endpoint:** `/system/status` (GET)
- **Services Checked:**
  - API (self)
  - PostgreSQL (simple query)
  - Redis (ping)
  - Worker (RQ worker registry)
  - Scheduler (RQ Scheduler jobs)
- **Caching:** Results are cached in-memory for 30 seconds to reduce load.
- **Manual Refresh:** Passing `?refresh=true` bypasses the cache and forces a real-time check.
- **Error Handling:** Each check is wrapped in try/except to ensure robust reporting.

## Testing
- **Test File:** `tests/api/test_system_status.py`
- **Test Strategy:**
  - All health check functions are patched in tests to ensure isolation from the real environment.
  - Tests cover healthy and unhealthy states, cache behavior, and schema validation.
  - The cache is cleared before each test to ensure independence.
- **Results:** All tests pass. The test suite is robust and not dependent on the state of actual containers/services.

## Key Decisions & Insights
- Chose to patch health check functions in tests to avoid integration test flakiness.
- Used a simple in-memory cache for performance, with a manual refresh for real-time needs.
- The endpoint is ready for frontend integration and further extension if needed.
