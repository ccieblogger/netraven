# Developer Log: Logs Page Display Issue Fix

**Date:** 2024-06-09
**Branch:** issue/96-log-page-refactor

## Context
- The logs page (`Logs.vue`) was not displaying due to a recursive update error in the DataTable component.
- Console error: `Maximum recursive updates exceeded in component <DataTable>`.

## Diagnosis
- The DataTable's `:totalRecords` prop was bound to `logStore.totalCount`, which does not exist in the Pinia store.
- The correct property is `logStore.pagination.totalItems`.
- This mismatch caused the DataTable to misbehave, resulting in a recursive update loop and page failure.

## Fix (Minimal)
- Updated the DataTable prop in `Logs.vue`:
  - From: `:totalRecords="logStore.totalCount"`
  - To:   `:totalRecords="logStore.pagination.totalItems"`
- No other logic or state changes were made.

## Commit
- Commit: fix(logs): use correct totalRecords prop to prevent DataTable recursion and restore logs page display

## Next Steps
- If further issues arise with query param syncing or event loops, consider a more robust watcher-based solution.

## 2024-06-09: Minimal PrimeVue DataTable Rewrite

- The previous incremental fixes did not resolve the recursive update and display issues.
- After reviewing 2024/2025 best practices, the logs page was rewritten from scratch:
  - Uses `<script setup>` and Pinia for state management.
  - Fetches logs on mount and displays them in a minimal PrimeVue DataTable.
  - No advanced filtering, sorting, or pagination yet—focus is on robust, clean display.
  - Loading state and empty state included.
- This approach follows current Vue/PrimeVue recommendations for maintainability and simplicity.

**Commit:** feat(logs): replace logs page with minimal PrimeVue DataTable using 2025 best practices (script setup, Pinia, clean fetch) 

## 2024-06-09: Mirror Dashboard Table Look and Feel

- Updated the logs page to match the look and feel of the Dashboard's DeviceTable:
  - Wrapped the table in the Card.vue component for consistent card styling.
  - Added a title and subtitle for context.
  - Applied DataTable props and column classes for consistent theming (stripedRows, responsiveLayout, min-w-full, header/body classes).
  - Styled the empty message and loading state to match the Dashboard.
- No logic changes—purely UI/UX improvements for consistency and professionalism.

**Commit:** style(logs): mirror Dashboard table look and feel using Card and themed DataTable styling 

## 2024-06-09: Add Column Filter Row to Logs Table

- Enhanced the logs page with a filter row directly under the table header, matching modern UI/UX best practices:
  - Used PrimeVue's `filterDisplay="row"` and per-column filters for searching.
  - Text input for most columns; dropdowns for log_type and level.
  - Filters update the table reactively as the user types/selects.
  - Styled filter row for clarity and consistency with the rest of the UI.
- This matches the user-provided screenshot and improves usability for large log sets.

**Commit:** feat(logs): add column filter row under table header for per-column searching (PrimeVue best practice)
