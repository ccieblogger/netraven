# Workstream 3: Timeline Slide-Over Panel (Issue #126)

## 2025-05-15

### Summary
- Implemented `TimelinePanel.vue` as a slide-over panel for device version timelines.
- Integrated Timeline action button into `DeviceTable.vue`.
- Connected panel open/close logic and device selection in `Devices.vue`.
- Committed changes to feature branch as per project coding principles.

### Details
- The TimelinePanel fetches and displays snapshots for the selected device, with View and Diff actions stubbed for next phases.
- DeviceTable emits a `timeline` event, which is handled in Devices.vue to open the panel.
- All UI is responsive and follows NetRaven theming.

### Next Steps
- Implement API integration for fetching real snapshot data.
- Wire up View and Diff actions.
- Add unit tests for TimelinePanel open/close and data rendering.

### Phase 2: API Integration, Actions, and Testing (2025-05-15)

#### Plan
- Integrate real API calls in `TimelinePanel.vue` to fetch device snapshots from the backend.
- Implement the View and Diff actions in the panel (open modal or navigate to diff view).
- Add unit tests for TimelinePanel open/close and data rendering.
- Document all changes and update this log and the GitHub issue.

#### Status
- Awaiting approval to proceed with implementation as per plan above.
