# Developer Log: Job Status Endpoint Pytest Coverage

## Summary
This log documents the process of reviewing and extending pytest coverage for the `/jobs/status` endpoint as part of GitHub issue #100. The goal is to ensure robust, authenticated, and unauthenticated access tests for the job status dashboard API.

## Test Plan
- Review existing tests for `/jobs/status` in `tests/api/test_jobs.py`.
- Ensure coverage for:
  - Authenticated access (already present, with mocking for Redis/RQ/worker)
  - Unauthenticated access (should return 401/403)
  - Invalid token access (should return 401/403)
- Add missing tests as needed.
- Document all changes and rationale.

## Codebase Findings
- The main test for `/jobs/status` is `test_get_jobs_status`, which uses monkeypatching to mock Redis, RQ, and worker objects.
- No tests existed for unauthenticated or invalid token access to `/jobs/status`.
- Similar auth-required tests exist for `/scheduler/jobs` and `/scheduler/queue/status` in `test_scheduler.py`.

## Actions Taken
- Added `test_jobs_status_auth_required` to verify that unauthenticated requests to `/jobs/status` are rejected (401/403).
- Added `test_jobs_status_invalid_token` to verify that requests with an invalid token are rejected (401/403).
- Tests follow the style and structure of the existing suite.

## Device Datatable Status Icon Wiring (June 2024)
- Extended the API service with `getLatestReachabilityJobResult(deviceId)` to fetch the latest reachability job result for a device.
- Added `fetchDevicesWithReachabilityStatus` to the device store, which fetches devices and then, for each device, fetches the latest reachability job result and sets `device.last_reachability_status`.
- Updated `Dashboard.vue` to use `fetchDevicesWithReachabilityStatus` on mount, ensuring each device row in the datatable has the correct status for the icon.
- The DeviceTable now displays a green check for success, red X for failure, and a white question mark if no job result is found.

## Next Steps
- Test the UI to ensure the correct icon is shown for each device status scenario.
- Consider batch optimization if the device list is large (future enhancement).
- Commit changes and update the GitHub issue with progress.
