# Phase 1: API Integration for Dynamic Job Registry (Issue 110, Work Stream 3)

## Date
2025-05-08

## Summary
- Refactored the `/jobs/job-types` API endpoint to return job type metadata from the dynamic `JOB_TYPE_META` registry (imported from `netraven.worker.job_registry`) instead of a static dictionary.
- The endpoint now dynamically lists all available job types and their metadata, supporting plug-and-play extensibility as described in the dynamic job registry specification.
- The `last_used` timestamp for each job type is still included, matching the previous API contract.

## Rationale
- This change enables the UI to display all available job types without requiring backend code changes for new job types.
- Aligns with NetRaven's extensibility and DRY principles.

## Next Steps
- Test the endpoint to ensure it returns the correct dynamic job type metadata.
- If required, coordinate with frontend/UI team to update their consumption of this endpoint.
- Proceed to Phase 2 (Developer Logging) after successful verification.
