# UI Dashboard Dynamic Job Type Icons (Issue 110, Work Stream 3)

## Date
2025-05-08

## Summary
- Refactored `JobTypesCard.vue` to use the `icon` field from the backend API for each job type.
- Mapped known icon strings to Heroicon Vue components (e.g., `CloudArrowDownIcon`, `SignalIcon`).
- Implemented a fallback to `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` if the icon string is missing or unrecognized, ensuring robust UI rendering.
- The dashboard and job dashboard now display job type icons and labels dynamically, reflecting backend changes without frontend code updates.

## Rationale
- Ensures all job type icons and labels are sourced from the backend, supporting true plug-and-play extensibility.
- Prevents UI breakage if a job type is missing an icon or the icon name is unrecognized.

## Next Steps
- Test by adding/removing job types in the backend and verifying the UI updates automatically.
- Extend this pattern to other pages/components as they are refactored.
