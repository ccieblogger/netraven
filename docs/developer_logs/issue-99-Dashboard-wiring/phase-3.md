# Phase 3 Developer Log: Dashboard Filters & Search Wiring

## Summary
- Refactored `deviceStore.fetchDevices` to accept filter/search/pagination params and forward them as query params to the backend API.
- Centralized filter/search state in the dashboard using a single `filterState` ref.
- Added debounced backend fetch on filter/search state changes (using lodash debounce).
- Removed all client-side filtering and pagination logic; device table now uses backend-driven data.
- Updated search input and pagination controls to bind to `filterState`.
- Updated computed properties for total pages/items to use backend data.

## Next Steps
- Test all filter/search and pagination interactions for correct backend integration.
- Review for any UI/UX regressions.
- Prepare for PR and update GitHub issue with progress.
