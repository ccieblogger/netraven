# Development Log: Issue #29 - Missing Add Tag Modal

## Phase 2: Modal Integration

**Date:** [auto-fill on commit]
**Branch:** issue/29-missing-add-tag-modal

### Summary
- Integrated `TagFormModal.vue` into `Tags.vue`.
- Replaced all placeholder modal logic and alerts with real modal open/close and CRUD handlers.
- Wired up modal events to tag store actions for create and update.
- Backend/store errors are now displayed in the modal if present.

### Key Decisions
- Used the same modal state and event pattern as other modals in the project for consistency.
- Modal is reused for both add and edit flows, with state managed via `isEditMode` and `selectedTag`.
- Error handling is surfaced to the user in the modal for better UX.

### Next Steps
- Test all flows (add, edit, cancel, error handling) in the UI.
- Clean up and refactor if any issues are found during testing.
- Prepare for code review and final documentation.

**What and Why:**
- What: Integrated the new modal into the tags management page, replacing all placeholder logic.
- Why: This enables the actual add/edit tag functionality and resolves the core of the reported bug.
