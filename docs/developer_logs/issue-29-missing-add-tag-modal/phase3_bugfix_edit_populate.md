# Development Log: Issue #29 - Missing Add Tag Modal

## Phase 3: Bugfix - Edit Modal Field Population

**Date:** [auto-fill on commit]
**Branch:** issue/29-missing-add-tag-modal

### Summary
- Fixed a bug where the Edit Tag modal did not populate fields with the selected tag's data.

### Root Cause
- The `resetForm()` function in `TagFormModal.vue` did not check if `tagToEdit` was non-null and had keys, so the form could be reset to empty even when editing.

### Solution
- Updated `resetForm()` to only use `tagToEdit` if it is non-null and has keys, ensuring the form is correctly populated when editing a tag.

### Verification
- Opened the Edit Tag modal for an existing tag and confirmed that the fields are now correctly populated with the tag's data.

**What and Why:**
- What: Fixed the edit modal so it always shows the correct tag data for editing.
- Why: This resolves a key usability bug and ensures the modal works as intended for both add and edit flows.
