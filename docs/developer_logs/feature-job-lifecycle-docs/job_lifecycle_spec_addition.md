# Developer Log: Addition of Job Lifecycle Design Spec

**Date:** 2024-06-09
**Author:** Nova (AI Assistant)

## Summary
Added a new architecture document: `job_lifecycle_spec.md` to `docs/architecture/`. This document provides a comprehensive design specification for the NetRaven job lifecycle, detailing the flow from job creation through scheduling, execution, and logging, with references to system components, technologies, and code locations.

## Rationale
- To provide clear, centralized documentation of the job orchestration pipeline for developers and maintainers.
- To support onboarding, troubleshooting, and future enhancements by mapping responsibilities and code locations.
- To align with project documentation standards and improve maintainability.

## File Location
- `docs/architecture/job_lifecycle_spec.md`

## Key Contents
- Executive summary
- System components overview
- Step-by-step job lifecycle
- ASCII flow diagram
- Responsibilities/code location table
- References to related architecture docs

## Next Steps
- Review and update as the job orchestration logic evolves.
- Cross-link from other relevant documentation sections as needed.
