# NotificationToast Integration Development Log

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the NotificationToast component integration in the NetRaven application. The component itself exists but was not properly integrated into the application layout.

## Implementation Plan

### Task 1: Component Analysis (COMPLETED)
- [x] Review the NotificationToast component implementation
- [x] Review the notification store implementation
- [x] Identify where the component should be integrated
- [x] Check how other components are using the notification store

### Task 2: Component Integration (COMPLETED)
- [x] Add the NotificationToast component to DefaultLayout.vue
- [x] Import the component in DefaultLayout.vue

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Analysis
- NotificationToast component is located at `frontend/src/components/NotificationToast.vue`
- Notification store is implemented at `frontend/src/store/notifications.js`
- The store provides methods for different notification types:
  - `info()`: Information notifications
  - `success()`: Success notifications
  - `warning()`: Warning notifications
  - `error()`: Error notifications
- Components like ConfigDiff.vue are already importing and using the notification store
- The DefaultLayout.vue is the ideal place to integrate the NotificationToast component as it wraps all authenticated pages

### 2. Component Integration
- Added import statement for NotificationToast in DefaultLayout.vue:
  ```javascript
  import NotificationToast from '../components/NotificationToast.vue';
  ```
- Added the component to the template at the top level of the layout:
  ```html
  <template>
    <div class="flex h-screen overflow-hidden">
      <!-- Notification Toast -->
      <NotificationToast />
      
      <!-- Rest of the layout... -->
    </div>
  </template>
  ```

## Current Status
The NotificationToast component has been successfully integrated into the application. The notification system is now fully functional, allowing components throughout the application to display toast notifications.

## Next Steps
None. Implementation is complete.

## Conclusion
The notification system in NetRaven is now fully operational. Any component using the notification store methods will now have their notifications displayed properly through the NotificationToast component.
