# UI/UX Design: Configuration Backup Module

This spec outlines a user-friendly interface in Vue 3.5.13 (headless-first) styled with your existing NetRaven theme and Tailwind CSS utility classes. It introduces a top-level **Backups** navigation parent, under which the Configuration Backup Viewer and any future backup-related pages live as children.

## üìÇ Navigation Structure

```text
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Backups
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Configuration Snapshots   ‚Üê Current page
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backup Schedules           ‚Üê Future scheduled jobs management
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Audit Logs                 ‚Üê Future change history overview
```

* **Backups (Parent)**: in the main side-nav, labeled with a hard-drive icon; expands/collapses its children.
* **Configuration Snapshots**: when selected, highlights in the nav and loads the Config Backup Viewer.
* **Child Links**: styled using `<NavLink>` components (headless) with active/inactive states matching the NetRaven color pallet (e.g., `text-primary` for active, `text-secondary` for inactive).

---

## üé® Theming & Style Guidelines

1. **Color Palette**: use your existing Tailwind palette tokens (e.g., `bg-card`, `text-text-primary`, `btn-primary`).
2. **Headless Components**: leverage headless UI libraries (e.g., @headlessui/vue) for accessible dropdowns, modals, and tabs‚Äîstyled via Tailwind to match the theme.
3. **Tailwind Config**: ensure Tailwind is configured with your custom NetRaven colors, typography, and border-radius scales so all components inherit consistent styling.
4. **Dark/Light Modes**: mirror your app‚Äôs global theme toggler; override Tailwind‚Äôs `dark:` variants on interactive elements.
5. **Responsive Breakpoints**: follow existing breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`), ensuring the timeline panel collapses into an accordion or slide-over on smaller viewports.

## üóÇ Main Pages & Components

### 1. Backups Parent Nav

* **Component**: `<SidebarGroup>` (headless) with props for label, icon, and child links array.
* **Behavior**: Click toggles its expanded state; active child automatically expands parent.

### 2. Configuration Snapshots Page

* **Search & Filter Bar** (persistent at top): InputText, DeviceDropdown (headless `<Listbox>`), DateRangePicker (headless `<Popover>`), and Search button.
* **Snapshots Table** (`<DataTable>`): columns for Device, Snapshot ID, Retrieved At, Snippet, Actions.
* **Actions**: Headless `<Menu>` for per-row actions: View, Diff, Download.

### 3. Timeline Slide-Over Panel

* **Component**: `<TransitionChild>` slide-over from right.
* **Content**: `<Timeline>` listing version bullets with timestamps and action buttons (icon-only `<Button>`s).

### 4. Diff Modal

* **Component**: `<Dialog>` from @headlessui/vue.
* **Selectors**: headless `<Listbox>` for version pickers.
* **Viewer**: `<pre>` wrapper with monospace font and line-number gutter; styled to highlight additions/deletions.

### 5. Raw Config Code View

* **Route**: `/backups/configurations/:device/:snapshotId`
* **Layout**: `<Split>` component into two panes; left: code block with copy button; right: optional diff view if `?diffWith` param present.

## üîÑ Interaction Flows & State

1. **Navigate**: User clicks **Backups** in sidebar ‚Üí children appear; clicking **Configuration Snapshots** loads page.
2. **Search**: User sets filters ‚Üí clicks Search ‚Üí calls `/configs/search` ‚Üí table data updates.
3. **View Timeline**: Click row‚Äôs **Actions > Timeline** ‚Üí slide-over opens, fetches `/configs/{device}` snapshots.
4. **Generate Diff**: From timeline or table, open Diff modal, select two versions ‚Üí on confirm, call `/configs/{d}/{v1}/diff/{v2}`.
5. **Download**: Click Download in menu ‚Üí triggers file download via API streaming.

## ‚úÖ Deployment Best Practices (May¬†2025)

* **Vue 3.5.13**: check the official docs for composition API improvements and headless-ui compatibility.
* **Bundling**: use Vite with the latest plugins for tree-shaking and faster dev reloads.
* **Accessibility (a11y)**: ensure headless components include proper ARIA roles‚Äîrefer to May¬†2025 best-practice guides on vuejs.org and @headlessui/vue repo.
* **Testing**: write Jest + Vue Testing Library tests for component states (nav expansion, modal open/close).

> **Developer Note**: Search online (May¬†2025) for the latest guidance on deploying Vue¬†3.5 apps‚Äîespecially around Vite production optimizations, CSS purging, and SSG/SSR options if applicable.

---

*This spec aligns with NetRaven‚Äôs existing style and headless-first philosophy, centralizing all backup-related features under a clear navigation hierarchy.*

# üöÄ Implementation Plan & GitHub Issues

Break the work into discrete, AI-assignable workstreams. Copy each section below as a separate GitHub Issue.

## Workstream 1: Sidebar Navigation & Routing

**Title:** Add Backups Parent Navigation and Child Routes

**Description:**
Implement the **Backups** parent in the existing sidebar, with child links for Configuration Snapshots, Backup Schedules, and Audit Logs. Set up Vue Router routes.

**Tasks:**

* Create a `<SidebarGroup>` component that accepts `label`, `icon`, and `children` props.
* Update main `Sidebar.vue` to import and render `<SidebarGroup>` for the Backups section.
* Define routes in `router/index.js`:

  ```js
  {
    path: '/backups',
    component: () => import('@/layouts/BackupsLayout.vue'),
    children: [
      { path: 'configurations', name: 'ConfigSnapshots', component: () => import('@/views/ConfigSnapshots.vue') },
      { path: 'schedules', name: 'BackupSchedules', component: () => import('@/views/BackupSchedules.vue') },
      { path: 'audit-logs', name: 'AuditLogs', component: () => import('@/views/AuditLogs.vue') },
    ]
  }
  ```
* Ensure active link highlighting uses `RouterLink` `exact-active` and Tailwind classes `text-primary` / `text-secondary`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Sidebar shows Backups parent, which expands/collapses.
* Clicking a child navigates to corresponding route and view (views can be placeholders).

---

## Workstream 2: Config Snapshots Page Scaffold

**Title:** Scaffold Configuration Snapshots View & Components

**Description:**
Build the base **Configuration Snapshots** page: search/filter bar, snapshots table, and placeholder actions.

**Tasks:**

* Create `views/ConfigSnapshots.vue` with:

  * `<SearchBar />` component containing InputText, DeviceDropdown (`<Listbox>`), DateRangePicker (`<Popover>`), and Search button.
  * `<SnapshotsTable />` component wired to a mock dataset.
* Define `components/SearchBar.vue` and `components/SnapshotsTable.vue`:

  * Use headless `<Listbox>`, `<Popover>`, and Tailwind styling.
  * DataTable columns: Device, Snapshot ID, Retrieved At, Snippet, Actions.
* Integrate sample API call stub using Axios to `/configs/search` (mock URL).
* Write basic unit tests (Vue Testing Library) for SearchBar and SnapshotsTable rendering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* ConfigSnapshots view loads with search bar and table populating sample data.
* Filters and search button exist but can be stubbed.

---

## Workstream 3: Timeline Slide-Over Panel

**Title:** Implement Timeline Slide-Over Panel for Snapshots

**Description:**
Develop the slide-over panel that shows the version timeline for a selected device.

**Tasks:**

* Create `components/TimelinePanel.vue` using `<TransitionChild>` to slide in from the right.
* Fetch snapshot list from API endpoint `/configs/{device}` on open.
* Render a `<Timeline>` list of items with timestamp and action buttons (View, Diff).
* Ensure panel is responsive: collapses to full-screen on `sm` breakpoint.
* Add unit tests for panel open/close and data rendering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Clicking Timeline action in table row opens the slide-over with a list of versions.
* Close button hides the panel.

---

## Workstream 4: Diff Modal Component

**Title:** Create Diff Modal with Version Selectors

**Description:**
Build the diff modal dialog that enables comparing two snapshots.

**Tasks:**

* Create `components/DiffModal.vue` with `<Dialog>` from @headlessui/vue.
* Include two `<Listbox>` components populated with passed `versions` prop.
* On Confirm, call API `/configs/{device}/{v1}/diff/{v2}` and display response in `<pre>` with monospace styling.
* Style additions/removals via CSS classes (`bg-green-100` for additions, `bg-red-100` for deletions).
* Write unit tests for modal open/close, selector binding, and diff rendering.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* DiffModal displays two dropdowns, a Generate button, and diff output area.
* Correct API call is made and results render properly.

---

## Workstream 5: Raw Config Viewer and Download

**Title:** Implement Raw Config View and Download Functionality

**Description:**
Add the route and view to display raw configuration text and enable file download.

**Tasks:**

* Create `views/ConfigRawView.vue` at route `/backups/configurations/:device/:snapshotId`.
* On mount, fetch `/configs/{device}/{snapshotId}` and display in a `<CodeBlock>` with copy-to-clipboard button.
* If query param `diffWith` is present, fetch and show diff side-by-side using a `<Split>` layout.
* Implement Download button that GETs the raw config and triggers a browser download (use `response.blob()`).
* Add tests verifying fetch and display behaviors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Visiting the raw view route shows the config text and allows copy/download.
* `?diffWith` toggles side-by-side diff view.

---

## Workstream 6: Integration & End-to-End Testing

**Title:** End-to-End Tests for Config Backup Module

**Description:**
Write E2E tests using Cypress (or preferred framework) covering primary user flows.

**Tasks:**

* Write E2E test for:

  1. Navigating to **Backups > Configuration Snapshots**.
  2. Performing a search and verifying table updates.
  3. Opening Timeline panel and checking snapshots list.
  4. Opening Diff modal and verifying diff content.
  5. Viewing raw config and downloading file.
* Mock API responses via fixtures to simulate backend.
* Ensure tests run in CI (update GitHub Actions workflow).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* All E2E scenarios pass in CI with mock data.
