# Developer Log: Phase 2 â€” Sidebar Child Indentation (Issue #104)

## Date: 2025-05-05

### Summary
Implemented recursive rendering for sidebar navigation and dynamic indentation for child items using a `level` prop, following 2025 best practices for Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS.

### Key Changes
- Refactored `SidebarNavGroup.vue` to render children recursively and pass a `level` prop.
- Updated `SidebarNavItem.vue` to accept a `level` prop and apply dynamic Tailwind `pl-*` classes for indentation.
- Updated `Sidebar.vue` to pass `level=0` to top-level groups for consistency.
- Removed static `ml-4` in favor of level-based padding for clarity and maintainability.

### Rationale
- Ensures proper visual hierarchy for nested navigation items.
- Supports arbitrary nesting for future extensibility.
- Aligns with current (2025) UI/UX standards for sidebar navigation.

### Next Steps
- Phase 3: Visual and accessibility testing in the UI.
- Phase 4: Document and finalize changes after successful testing.
