# Workstream 4: Diff Modal Component â€“ Phase 2 Refactor Log

## Date: 2025-05-18

### Summary
- Refactored `handleDiffSnapshot` in `ConfigSnapshots.vue` to use the correct `configSnapshotsService.getSnapshot(deviceId, snapshotId)` and `getDiff(deviceId, snapshotId1, snapshotId2)` methods for clarity and maintainability.
- Ensured DRY principle and alignment with backend API structure.
- No errors after refactor; code committed to feature branch.

### Next Steps
- Review accessibility and error/loading UI in the diff modal.
- Add/verify unit and integration tests for the diff modal workflow.
- Continue logging progress here and in the GitHub issue.
