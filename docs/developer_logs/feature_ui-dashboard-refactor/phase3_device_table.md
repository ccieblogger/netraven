# Phase 3: Device List Table â€” Implementation Log

**Date:** [Auto-generated]

## Summary
- Integrated the new `DeviceTable` component into the dashboard view.
- Added a filter/search bar above the table using `ResourceFilter` and a search input.
- Added `PaginationControls` below the table for paginated device lists.
- Wired up all props and events for filtering, searching, and pagination.
- All UI uses the global theme and is accessible.

## Rationale

- Ensures filtering, searching, and pagination are consistent and accessible.
- Lays the groundwork for further enhancements (responsive card view, accessibility testing, etc.).

## Next Steps
- Implement modals for edit/delete actions and wire up reachability checks.
- Test for responsiveness and accessibility.
- Finalize documentation and prepare for review/merge.

- Updated `DeviceTable.vue` to set the paginator background color to match the row color (`bg-slate-800`) using the PrimeVue v4+ `pt` prop: `paginator: { class: 'bg-slate-800' }`.
- This follows 2025 best practices for DataTable theming and ensures visual consistency between the table rows and paginator.
- No fallback CSS override was needed at this stage.
