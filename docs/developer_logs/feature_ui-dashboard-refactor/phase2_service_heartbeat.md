# Phase 2: Service Heartbeat Row â€” Implementation Log

**Date:** [Auto-generated]

## Summary
- Implemented a new globally reusable `ServiceDot` component for service status indicators on the dashboard.
- Refactored the dashboard system status row to use `ServiceDot` for each service (API, Redis, Worker, etc.), replacing the previous `StatusBadge` usage.
- `ServiceDot` uses the global color palette, is keyboard accessible, ARIA-compliant, and provides accessible tooltips.
- Tooltip and status logic are now standardized and reusable.

## Key Decisions
- Chose to create a dedicated `ServiceDot` component for clarity, reusability, and to enforce consistent dot size, color, and accessibility.
- Kept the component simple and DRY, using Tailwind and project CSS variables for all styling.
- Tooltip content is passed via props or slot, and ARIA labels are auto-generated for accessibility.

## Next Steps
- Test the new component and dashboard row for accessibility and responsiveness.
- Begin Phase 3: Device List Table audit and planning.
