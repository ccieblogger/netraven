# Phase 4: Device Actions â€” Implementation Log

**Date:** [Auto-generated]

## Summary
- Wired up `DeviceFormModal` for editing devices and `DeleteConfirmationModal` for deleting devices from the dashboard.
- Implemented state and handlers for opening/closing modals, passing device data, and refreshing the device list after actions.
- Wired up the reachability check action to trigger the appropriate job via the job store, with user feedback using the notification store.
- **Added credential-check and view-configs actions to the device actions column, grouped as secondary actions.**
- Credential-check triggers the appropriate job and shows user feedback. View Configs navigates to `/backups?device_id=...`.
- All actions use global components, are accessible, and have ARIA labels/tooltips.

## Rationale
- Provides a complete, interactive device management experience directly from the dashboard.
- Ensures all user actions are accessible, themed, and provide clear feedback.
- Reuses existing, tested modal and notification components for consistency and maintainability.
- Groups primary and secondary actions for better UX.

## Next Steps
- Test all actions for correct behavior, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- Finalize documentation and prepare for review/merge.
