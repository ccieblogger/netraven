# Phase 2 Log - feature-diffviewer-jsdiff

## Date: 2025-05-19

### Actions Completed:
- Refactored `DiffViewer.vue` to use `createTwoFilesPatch` from the `diff` (jsdiff) package for generating unified diffs.
- Removed the old manual diff string generation logic.
- Verified that all UI features (view toggle, copy-to-clipboard, theming) remain in place.
- Staged and committed the changes to the feature branch.

### Next Steps:
- Test the new diff output in the UI for proper line alignment and blank spaces in side-by-side view (Phase 3).
- Adjust Diff2Html options if needed.
- Commit after successful integration and update this log.
