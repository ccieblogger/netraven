# Phase 4 Log - feature-diffviewer-jsdiff

## Date: 2025-05-19

### Actions Completed:
- Added CSS to hide the file summary/file list block (Diff2Html `.d2h-file-list-wrapper` and `.d2h-file-header`) in the diff viewer.
- This resolves the cosmetic issue where an empty or misaligned block appeared at the bottom of the diff output.
- Staged and committed the fix to the feature branch.

### Next Steps:
- Rebuild and test the frontend container to confirm the cosmetic fix.
- If confirmed, proceed to final documentation and close out the enhancement.
