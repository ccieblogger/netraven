# Phase 1 Log - feature-diffviewer-jsdiff

## Date: 2025-05-19

### Actions Completed:
- Installed the `diff` (jsdiff) package in the `frontend` directory using `npm install diff`.
- Verified that `diff` is now listed in `frontend/package.json` dependencies.
- Confirmed that the Docker build process for the frontend already uses `npm ci` and will include the new dependency automatically.
- No changes required to the Dockerfile for this dependency, as it is managed by `package.json`.

### Next Steps:
- Refactor `DiffViewer.vue` to use `createTwoFilesPatch` from `diff` for diff generation (Phase 2).
- Remove old manual diff logic.
- Commit after refactor and update this log.
