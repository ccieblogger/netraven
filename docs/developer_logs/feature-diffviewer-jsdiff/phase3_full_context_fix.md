# Phase 3 Log - feature-diffviewer-jsdiff

## Date: 2025-05-19

### Actions Completed:
- Updated `DiffViewer.vue` to set the `context` option in `createTwoFilesPatch` to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.
- This ensures the full configuration for both A & B is shown in the side-by-side and unified diff views, not just the changed lines.
- Staged and committed the fix to the feature branch.

### Next Steps:
- Rebuild and test the frontend container to confirm the full diff is now visible as expected.
- If confirmed, proceed to final documentation and cleanup (Phase 4).
