# API Testing Analysis and Development Plan

## Initial Analysis

### Date: 2023-07-21

Today I began analyzing the NetRaven codebase to understand the API structure and test coverage. The project follows a standard FastAPI architecture with:

1. Main API app configured in `netraven/api/main.py`
2. Routers for different resource types in `netraven/api/routers/`
3. Some test coverage in `tests/api/` but with gaps

## Current API Endpoint Structure

Based on my initial analysis, the following API routers are implemented:

1. **Authentication** (`/auth`)
   - POST `/auth/token` - Login and get JWT token

2. **Users** (`/users`)
   - Full CRUD operations for user management

3. **Devices** (`/devices`)
   - Full CRUD operations
   - GET `/devices/{device_id}/credentials` - Get credentials for specific device

4. **Credentials** (`/credentials`)
   - Operations for managing device credentials

5. **Tags** (`/tags`)
   - Operations for managing tags (used for both devices and jobs)

6. **Jobs** (`/jobs`)
   - CRUD operations for job definitions
   - POST `/jobs/run/{job_id}` - Trigger job execution

7. **Logs** (`/logs`)
   - Endpoints for retrieving system logs

8. **Backups** (`/backups`)
   - Appears to be a placeholder router with minimal implementation

9. **Health Check** (`/health`)
   - Basic health check endpoint at root level

## Current Test Coverage

The test coverage is partial:

- `test_auth.py` - Tests for authentication
- `test_tags.py` - Tests for tag operations
- `test_device_credentials.py` - Tests for device credential operations
- `test_backups.py` - Basic tests for backup functionality

Missing test files:
- No dedicated tests for `/devices` endpoints (except credentials)
- No tests for `/jobs` endpoints
- No tests for `/users` endpoints
- No tests for `/logs` endpoints

## API Testing Gap Analysis

1. **Missing endpoint tests**:
   - Devices CRUD operations
   - Jobs CRUD operations
   - Users CRUD operations
   - Logs retrieval endpoints

2. **Special cases to test**:
   - Pagination functionality
   - Filtering functionality
   - Role-based access control
   - Error handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Test Coverage for Basic Endpoints

1. Create test suite for devices endpoints
   - CRUD operations
   - Filtering and pagination
   - Tag association

2. Create test suite for jobs endpoints
   - CRUD operations
   - Job triggering
   - Tag association

3. Create test suite for users endpoints
   - CRUD operations
   - Role-based access control

4. Create test suite for logs endpoints
   - Log retrieval
   - Filtering

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Error Handling Tests

1. Add negative test cases for all endpoints
   - Invalid input handling
   - Not found cases
   - Permission errors

### Phase 3: Integration Tests

1. Test inter-related functionality
   - Device and credential relationship
   - Job execution and results

### Phase 4: Performance and Pagination Tests

1. Test pagination behavior with larger datasets
2. Test filtering efficiency

## Next Steps

1. Implement test_devices.py to cover device CRUD operations
2. Implement test_jobs.py to cover job operations
3. Implement test_users.py to cover user management
4. Implement test_logs.py to cover log retrieval

Will update this log as I progress through implementation.
