# Phase 2: Fernet Key Management Integration Log

## Summary
This document describes the implementation of universal Fernet key management for device credential encryption/decryption in NetRaven. The approach ensures all containers use a single, persistent Fernet key, injected at runtime, and that all credential seeding and access is consistent and secure.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Key Generation:**
   - Script at `docker/setup/generate_fernet_key.sh` generates and persists a Fernet key at `docker/fernet_key`.
2. **Compose Integration:**
   - All relevant services (api, worker) mount `docker/fernet_key/fernet.key` and set the environment variable `NETRAVEN_SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_KEY` from this file in their entrypoint script.
   - **Entrypoint scripts check for the Fernet key at container startup. If the key is missing, the container exits immediately with a clear error message.**
3. **Credential Seeding:**
   - All credential seeding scripts use the Fernet key from the mounted file for encryption.
4. **Testing:**
   - Confirmed that credential encryption/decryption works across all containers and jobs.

## Best Practices
- The Fernet key is never hardcoded in compose files or images.
- All encryption/decryption is handled via the universal key, ensuring consistency and security.
- **Containers will not start if the Fernet key is missing, preventing insecure or misconfigured operation.**
- The process is documented for future maintainers.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any issues with credential access in jobs or API.
- Rotate the Fernet key as needed, re-encrypting credentials if required.
