# Developer Log: Device Modal Two-Column Layout Fix

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Branch:** issue/134-extend-devices-ws3

## Summary
- Refactored `DeviceFormModal.vue` to ensure a true two-column layout for main device fields on desktop, stacking on mobile.
- Moved all main fields (hostname, ip, type, port, serial, model, source, tags) into a single grid container.
- Placed description and notes in a full-width row below the main grid.
- Credentials info and read-only fields remain full-width at the bottom.
- Removed the CSS override that forced `.grid-cols-2` to always be one column on mobile, so `md:grid-cols-2` now works as intended.
- Committed as: `fix(ui): true two-column layout for DeviceFormModal, improved responsive design`

## Next Steps
- Await user review/approval of the new modal layout.
- Proceed to further UI/UX refinements or next sub-phase if requested.
