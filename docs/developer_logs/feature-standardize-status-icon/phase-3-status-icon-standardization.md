# Phase 3: Status Icon Standardization

**Date:** [Auto-generated]
**Developer:** Nova (AI Assistant)

## Summary
Standardized the status icon rendering in the DeviceTable.vue "Reachable" column by introducing a new StatusIcon.vue component. This replaces the custom ServiceDot dot with a standard PrimeVue icon, ensuring consistency with action icons and improving accessibility and theming.

## Changes Made
- Created `StatusIcon.vue` in `frontend/src/components/ui/`:
  - Maps status (`healthy`, `unhealthy`, `warning`, `unknown`) to a standard icon and color.
  - Supports tooltips for accessibility.
- Updated `DeviceTable.vue`:
  - Replaced `<ServiceDot />` with `<StatusIcon />` in the "Reachable" column.
  - Passed mapped status and tooltip props.
  - Imported `StatusIcon` instead of `ServiceDot`.
- Removed `ServiceDot.vue` to avoid code duplication.

## Rationale
- Ensures UI consistency by using the same icon method as action icons.
- Improves visibility, accessibility, and maintainability.
- Reduces custom code and leverages existing icon libraries.

## Next Steps
- Test the UI for correct icon rendering and tooltip behavior.
- Solicit feedback from stakeholders on the new look.
- Refactor any other custom status indicators to use `StatusIcon` for further consistency if needed.
