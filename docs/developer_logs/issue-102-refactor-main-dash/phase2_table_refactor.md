# Developer Log: Dashboard UI Refactor (issue/102-refactor-main-dash)

## Phase 2: Table Refactor

**Date:** 2025-05-05

### Actions Completed
- Created `DeviceInventoryTable.vue` as a native HTML table styled after `JobsTable.vue` (Tailwind, modern look).
- Updated `Dashboard.vue` to use `DeviceInventoryTable` instead of the old PrimeVue `DeviceTable`.
- Removed all PrimeVue-specific table and filter logic from `Dashboard.vue`.
- All device actions (edit, delete, reachability, credential check, view configs) are present and working in the new table.

### Component Reorganization
- Created `frontend/src/components/dashboard/` folder to house all dashboard-specific components.
- Moved `DeviceInventoryTable.vue` into this new folder.
- Updated imports in `Dashboard.vue` accordingly.
- This mirrors the organization of the `jobs-dashboard` feature and improves maintainability.

### Next Steps
- Phase 3: Implement a new `DeviceFiltersBar.vue` (styled after `JobFiltersBar.vue`) and move all device filters to the filter bar above the table.
- Bind filter bar controls to the table's data and remove any remaining filter logic from the table itself.

**Awaiting review/approval before proceeding to Phase 3.**
