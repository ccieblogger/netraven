# Developer Log: Raw Config Viewer Implementation

## Date: 2025-05-16

### Summary
- Implemented the Raw Config Viewer page (`ConfigRawView.vue`) as specified in GitHub Issue 128.
- Created supporting components (`CodeBlock.vue`, `Split.vue`).
- Added route to `/backups/configurations/:device/:snapshotId`.
- Removed JavaScript unit test file as project does not use Jest or Vue Test Utils; testing will be performed manually.

### Actions
- All code changes are in the `frontend/src/pages/`, `frontend/src/components/`, and router files.
- No frontend JavaScript test dependencies are required or used.
- Manual testing instructions: Navigate to the new route in the running app and verify config fetch, diff, copy, and download behaviors.

### Next Steps
- Perform manual QA.
- Update GitHub issue with implementation and testing notes.
