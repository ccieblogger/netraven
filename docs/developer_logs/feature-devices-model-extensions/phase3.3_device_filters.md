# Phase 3.3: Device Search/Filter UI â€“ Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Branch:** issue/134-extend-devices-ws3

## Summary
- Updated `DeviceFiltersBar.vue` to add filters for new device fields: model, source (dropdown), notes, last_updated, and updated_by.
- Ensured all new filters are bound to local state and emit updates correctly.
- UI tested for usability and correct filter propagation.

## Next Steps
- Review filter logic in parent component (Devices.vue) to ensure new fields are handled in device queries.
- Pause for review and commit after confirmation.
