# Job Logging System Overview

## Introduction

[Provide an introduction to the job logging system and its importance in the NetRaven architecture. Explain how it relates to the Gateway component and the overall system.]

## Vision and Goals

[Describe your vision for the job logging system and the key goals it should achieve.]

- Goal 1
- Goal 2
- Goal 3

## System Architecture

[Outline the architecture of the job logging system, including how it integrates with other NetRaven components.]

```
[Insert architectural diagram here]
```

## Core Functionality

### Log Collection

[Describe how logs should be collected from different sources within the system.]

### Log Storage

[Explain your vision for how logs should be stored, including retention policies, storage formats, etc.]

### Log Processing

[Detail how logs should be processed, including any transformations, enrichment, or correlation that should occur.]

### Log Access

[Describe how users and systems should access logs, including APIs, interfaces, and access controls.]

## Log Levels and Categories

[Define the log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and categories or types of logs that should be captured.]

| Level | Description | Example Use Case |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| DEBUG | | |
| INFO | | |
| WARNING | | |
| ERROR | | |
| CRITICAL | | |

## Structured Logging Format

[Describe the format for structured logs including fields that should be present in all log entries.]

```json
{
  "timestamp": "",
  "level": "",
  "message": "",
  "job_id": "",
  "component": "",
  "additional_fields": {}
}
```

## Performance Requirements

[Document performance requirements such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization.]

## Security and Compliance

[Detail security considerations for the logging system including access control, sensitive data handling, and compliance requirements.]

## Monitoring and Alerting

[Explain how the logging system should support monitoring and alerting capabilities.]

## Integration Points

[Describe how the job logging system should integrate with other systems such as monitoring tools, SIEM solutions, etc.]

## User Interface

[Outline requirements for user interfaces to access and analyze logs.]

## Implementation Roadmap

[Sketch a potential roadmap for implementing the job logging system.]

1. Phase 1: [Basic functionality]
2. Phase 2: [Advanced features]
3. Phase 3: [Optimization and scaling]
