# Docker Build System and Integration Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to:
1. Fix issues with the Docker build system
2. Implement comprehensive integration testing
3. Verify the application fully works from UI to device communication

## Docker Build System Fixes

### Phase 1: Dependency Resolution (1-2 days) ✅

**Current Issues:**
- PyYAML installation failures due to compatibility issues with newer Cython versions
- Potential permission issues with non-root users
- Configuration file access and paths

**Fixes Implemented:**
- Added required system dependencies to all Dockerfiles:
  - gcc
  - libyaml-dev
  - python3-dev
- Created proper non-root user setup for all containers
- Ensured configuration files are properly copied and accessible
- Fixed environment variable references
- Pinned PyYAML to version 5.3.1 in requirements.txt for better compatibility

### Phase 2: Container Build Verification (1 day) ✅

1. Build and verify each container individually:
   ```bash
   # Build API container
   docker build -f Dockerfile.api -t netraven-api:test .
   
   # Build Gateway container
   docker build -f Dockerfile.gateway -t netraven-gateway:test .
   
   # Build Key Rotation container
   docker build -f docker/key-rotation.Dockerfile -t netraven-key-rotation:test .
   ```

2. Perform smoke tests on individual containers:
   ```bash
   # Test API container
   docker run --rm netraven-api:test python -c "import yaml; print('PyYAML works!')"
   
   # Test Gateway container 
   docker run --rm netraven-gateway:test python -c "import yaml; print('PyYAML works!')"
   ```

### Phase 3: Docker Compose Verification (1 day) ✅

1. Build all containers using docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the entire stack:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Verify connectivity between services:
   ```bash
   # Check API health
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Check Gateway health
   curl http://localhost:8001/health
   ```

### Current Status (Updated 2025-05-11)

Recent testing confirms that the Docker build system is currently functioning correctly with no critical errors:

- ✅ All containers build successfully without dependency errors
- ✅ PyYAML and other dependencies install correctly
- ✅ Non-root user setup works properly
- ✅ Configuration file paths are correctly set

**Remaining Issues:**

1. Warning about obsolete `version` attribute in docker-compose.yml:
   ```
   WARN[0000] /home/netops/Projects2025/python/netraven/docker-compose.yml: the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
   ```

2. Build performance optimization opportunity:
   ```
   Compose now can delegate build to bake for better performances
   Just set COMPOSE_BAKE=true
   ```

**Recommendation:**
- These remaining issues are quality improvements rather than critical fixes
- They can be addressed with lower priority as they don't affect system functionality
- Setting `COMPOSE_BAKE=true` can be considered for improving build performance

## Integration Testing Implementation

### Phase 1: Test Framework Setup (2-3 days)

1. Create a dedicated integration test directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p tests/integration
   ```

2. Set up test fixtures for integration testing:
   - Database integration fixtures
   - API client fixtures
   - Device simulation fixtures

3. Implement Docker-based test environment:
   - Create `docker-compose.test.yml` for testing environment
   - Set up test database with pre-loaded fixtures

### Phase 2: Component Integration Tests (3-4 days)

1. API Gateway to Backend integration tests:
   - User authentication flows
   - Device management operations
   - Job creation and tracking

2. Scheduler Service integration tests:
   - Job scheduling and execution
   - Integration with Job Logging Service
   - Task notification and status updates

3. Device Communication Service integration tests:
   - Protocol adapter tests with simulated devices
   - Error handling and recovery scenarios
   - Credential management integration

### Phase 3: End-to-End Testing (2-3 days)

1. Create end-to-end test scenarios:
   - User login to job completion flows
   - Device discovery and management flows
   - Credential management to device access flows

2. Implement device simulation framework:
   - Mock SSH/Telnet servers for device simulation
   - Configurable response scenarios
   - Latency and error simulation

3. Automated UI testing:
   - Implement tests for critical user flows
   - Verify UI updates with backend state changes

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Task | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|------|----------|--------------|
| Docker 1 | Dependency Resolution | 1-2 days | None |
| Docker 2 | Container Build Verification | 1 day | Docker 1 |
| Docker 3 | Docker Compose Verification | 1 day | Docker 2 |
| Testing 1 | Test Framework Setup | 2-3 days | Docker 3 |
| Testing 2 | Component Integration Tests | 3-4 days | Testing 1 |
| Testing 3 | End-to-End Testing | 2-3 days | Testing 2 |

Total estimated duration: 10-14 days

## Success Criteria

1. All Docker containers build successfully without dependency errors
2. Docker Compose stack starts up correctly with all services communicating
3. Integration tests pass with at least 85% code coverage
4. End-to-end user flows work correctly from UI to device communication
5. System can handle simulated device failures gracefully
6. All tests are automated and can be run via CI/CD pipeline

## Future Enhancements

After completing the Docker build and integration testing phases, we can consider:

1. Performance benchmark testing
2. Load testing under high concurrency
3. Security scanning and penetration testing
4. Cross-platform compatibility testing
