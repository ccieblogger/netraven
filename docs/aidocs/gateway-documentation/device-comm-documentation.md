# Device Communication Overview

## Introduction

The Device Communication system in NetRaven provides a standardized interface for connecting to and managing network devices through the Gateway component. It offers a consistent approach to device interaction regardless of vendor or model specifics. The system:

- Provides a standard interface to connect to network devices via SSH, abstracting the complexities of different device types and connection methods
- Logs each step of the connection and communication process to the standard job logging facility, creating comprehensive audit trails and facilitating troubleshooting
- Uses login credentials assigned via the NetRaven credentials system to securely authenticate to devices, leveraging the centralized credential management capabilities
- Provides retry mechanisms for using each credential assigned to the device via the credentials system, automatically attempting alternative credentials if the initial authentication fails

This component serves as the foundation for all device interactions in the NetRaven platform, ensuring secure, reliable, and traceable communications with network infrastructure.
