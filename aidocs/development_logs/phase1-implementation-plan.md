# NetRaven Architecture Redesign Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation plan for the NetRaven architecture redesign, with current progress and next steps. As this is a new product with no existing deployments, we can implement changes directly without backwards compatibility concerns.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Phase 1.1: Docker build system improvements completed (feature/phase1.1-docker-build-improvements)
- ‚è≥ Phase 1.2: Async support implementation pending
- üìÖ Remaining phases not started

## Branching Strategy
Each phase and major component has its own feature branch to maintain clean, focused changes:

```
develop
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase1.1-docker-build-improvements (current/completed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase1.2-async-support
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase2.1-protocol-adapters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase2.2-command-templating
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase3.1-error-recovery
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase3.2-integration-testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase4.1-feature-flags
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/phase4.2-documentation
```

### Branch Naming Convention
- Format: `feature/phase<major>.<minor>-<description>`
- Example: `feature/phase1.1-docker-build-improvements`
- Each branch should focus on a specific component or functionality
- Branches should be merged into develop upon completion and approval

## Phase 1: Infrastructure and Build System

### Phase 1.1: Docker Build System Improvements (Current/Completed)
Branch: `feature/phase1.1-docker-build-improvements`

#### Changes Implemented
1. **Multi-stage Build Implementation**
   - Created separate build and runtime stages in `Dockerfile.api`
   - Build stage handles compilation and dependency installation
   - Runtime stage contains only necessary components
   - Reduced final image size by excluding build tools

2. **Layer Optimization**
   - Added `.dockerignore` file for build optimization
   - Reordered Dockerfile instructions for better caching
   - Grouped related operations to reduce layers
   - Optimized COPY operations with proper ownership

3. **Security Improvements**
   - Added no-new-privileges security option
   - Implemented read-only root filesystem
   - Added tmpfs for writable directories
   - Configured proper volume and bind mount permissions

4. **Configuration Improvements**
   - Removed obsolete version from docker-compose.yml
   - Enhanced healthcheck configurations
   - Standardized environment variable format
   - Improved volume definitions with explicit types

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented proper connection pooling settings
   - Optimized healthcheck intervals
   - Added appropriate start periods for services
   - Improved dependency chain

#### Files Modified
1. `Dockerfile.api`
   - Implemented multi-stage build
   - Optimized layer structure
   - Enhanced security configurations

2. `docker-compose.yml`
   - Removed obsolete version
   - Updated volume configurations
   - Enhanced security settings
   - Improved healthchecks

3. `.dockerignore`
   - Added comprehensive ignore patterns
   - Optimized build context

### Phase 1.2: Async Support Implementation (Next Up)
Branch: `feature/phase1.2-async-support`

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Database Operations**
   - Update Database Connection Pool
     ```python
     # in netraven/core/db.py
     from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
     
     async def get_async_db_pool():
         engine = create_async_engine(
             DATABASE_URL,
             pool_size=20,
             max_overflow=10,
             pool_timeout=30,
             pool_pre_ping=True
         )
         return engine
     ```
   - Implement all database operations as async from the start
   - Configure connection pooling for optimal performance
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

2. **Service Layer Implementation**
   - Device Communication Service
     - Implement async device operations
     - Configure connection pooling
     - Add timeout handling
   - Job Processing
     - Implement async job queue processing
     - Add async job status updates
     - Implement async event notifications

3. **API Layer Implementation**
   - Implement all endpoints as async
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Add request timeout handling

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create async test fixtures
   - Implement async database testing
   - Add async mock utilities

## Phase 2: Protocol and Communication (3 weeks)

### Phase 2.1: Protocol Adapter Extensions
Branch: `feature/phase2.1-protocol-adapters`

1. **Telnet Protocol Adapter**
   - Implement async Telnet client
   - Add connection pooling
   - Add security controls

2. **REST Protocol Adapter**
   - Implement async REST client
   - Add rate limiting
   - Add security headers

### Phase 2.2: Command Templating
Branch: `feature/phase2.2-command-templating`

1. **Template System**
   - Implement Jinja2-based template engine
   - Create template repository
   - Add template validation

## Phase 3: Reliability and Testing (2 weeks)

### Phase 3.1: Error Recovery
Branch: `feature/phase3.1-error-recovery`

1. **Retry Strategies**
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Add circuit breaker pattern
   - Add failure monitoring

### Phase 3.2: Integration Testing
Branch: `feature/phase3.2-integration-testing`

1. **Test Implementation**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Implement stress testing

## Phase 4: Feature Management (1 week)

### Phase 4.1: Feature Flags
Branch: `feature/phase4.1-feature-flags`

1. **Configuration System**
   - Implement feature flag management
   - Add UI components
   - Add monitoring

### Phase 4.2: Documentation
Branch: `feature/phase4.2-documentation`

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update all documentation
   - Remove deprecated code
   - Add troubleshooting guides

## Git Workflow for Each Branch
1. Create feature branch from develop using the naming convention
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/phase<major>.<minor>-<description>
   ```

2. Make focused commits with clear messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "phase<major>.<minor>: <clear description of change>"
   ```

3. Test thoroughly before review

4. Review with project owner

5. After approval, merge to develop
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/phase<major>.<minor>-<description>
   git push origin develop
   ```

6. Delete feature branch after successful merge
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/phase<major>.<minor>-<description>
   ```

## Coding Principles
1. Keep files under 200-300 lines
2. No code duplication
3. No temporary scripts in production code
4. No stubbing or fake data in production
5. Clean up after each phase
6. Maintain deployment model compatibility
7. Use simple solutions over complex ones
8. Remove old implementations when introducing new patterns

## Next Steps for Next Developer
1. Current branch (feature/phase1.1-docker-build-improvements) is complete
2. Create feature/phase1.2-async-support branch next
3. Follow the implementation plan for async support
4. Maintain the branching strategy for clean, focused changes
5. Document any deviations from this plan

## Release Process
After completing all phases:
1. Create release branch from develop
2. Perform final testing
3. Update version numbers
4. Tag release
5. Merge to main

## Notes
- This is a new product - implement best practices from the start
- No need for backwards compatibility
- Focus on clean, efficient implementations
- Document all architectural decisions
- Keep security as a primary concern
- Each feature branch should be focused and independent
- Branch names should clearly indicate their purpose and phase
