# Phase 3.1 Completion: Async Support with PostgreSQL Testing

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of Phase 3.1, focusing on the implementation of async support across the application with proper PostgreSQL configuration for Docker environments.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration for Docker
- Updated test connection logic to detect Docker environment and use the service name `postgres` instead of `localhost`
- Configured tests to use the main application database for testing
- Simplified connection parameters to reuse existing environment variables

### 2. Test Environment Updates
- Fixed the event loop scope mismatch issues with pytest-asyncio
- Added debug logging for database connections
- Ensured all test files use consistent connection parameters

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated development logs to reflect PostgreSQL usage in tests
- Added clear instructions for running tests in Docker

## Testing in Docker
In the Docker environment, tests connect to the main PostgreSQL database using the container network. This approach:

1. **Simplifies Configuration**: Uses the existing database without requiring separate test databases
2. **Improves Reliability**: Tests run against the same database schema as the application
3. **Reduces Complexity**: No need for separate connection strings or credential management

## Running Async Tests
The async tests can be run within the application containers:

```bash
docker-compose exec api pytest -v tests/test_async_*.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Continue improving and expanding async support across the application
2. Add more comprehensive test cases for async operations
3. Consider implementing performance testing for async features
