# Phase 3.1 Completion: Async Support with PostgreSQL Testing

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of Phase 3.1, focusing on the implementation of async support across the application with proper PostgreSQL database configuration for testing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Test Database Configuration
- Updated `conftest.py` to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite for tests
- Modified database connection strings to use `asyncpg` driver for PostgreSQL
- Added environment variable support for test database configuration
- Implemented proper connection pooling for async PostgreSQL operations

### 2. Test Environment Updates
- Updated `db_init.py` to use PostgreSQL with appropriate connection parameters
- Fixed the async scheduler service tests to use PostgreSQL
- Added session-scoped event loop fixture to fix scope mismatch issues with pytest-asyncio
- Removed SQLite-specific code and dependencies

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Updated development logs to reflect PostgreSQL usage in tests
- Added clear instructions for configuring PostgreSQL for testing
- Corrected references to SQLite in README and development logs
- Added recommendations for test environment setup

### 4. Dependency Management
- Removed `aiosqlite` from requirements.txt as it's no longer needed
- Retained `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL async operations
- Ensured all Docker containers have the proper database drivers installed

## Benefits of PostgreSQL for Testing
1. **Production Parity**: Tests now run against the same database technology used in production
2. **Full Feature Support**: PostgreSQL supports all the data types and features used by the application
3. **Better SQL Compatibility**: Tests now execute the same SQL statements that will run in production
4. **Improved Reliability**: Tests will catch PostgreSQL-specific issues earlier in development

## Configuration Requirements
To run tests, the following environment variables can be set (or defaults will be used):
- `TEST_DB_USER`: PostgreSQL username (default: "postgres")
- `TEST_DB_PASS`: PostgreSQL password (default: "postgres")
- `TEST_DB_HOST`: PostgreSQL host (default: "localhost")
- `TEST_DB_PORT`: PostgreSQL port (default: "5432")
- `TEST_DB_NAME`: PostgreSQL database name (default: "netraven_test")

## Running Async Tests
The async tests can be run within the application containers to ensure proper environment configuration:

```bash
docker-compose exec api pytest -v tests/test_async_*.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Continue improving and expanding async support across the application
2. Add more comprehensive test cases for async operations
3. Consider implementing performance testing for async features
