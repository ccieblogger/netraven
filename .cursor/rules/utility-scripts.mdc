## Utility Scripts

### Development Environment Management

NetRaven provides utility scripts to simplify development workflow and environment management:

#### manage_netraven.sh

Located in the `/setup` directory, this script serves as the primary tool for managing NetRaven's containerized environment:

```bash
./setup/manage_netraven.sh [command] [environment]
```

**Commands:**
- `start` - Start all NetRaven services (Redis, PostgreSQL, API, Frontend)
- `stop` - Stop all running services
- `reset-db` - Reset only the database (drop and recreate PostgreSQL)
- `reset-all` - Reset all containers and volumes (complete reinstall)
- `install-deps` - Install all dependencies (Python, Node.js, Redis)
- `switch-env` - Switch between development and release environments
- `restart [service]` - Restart individual services (frontend, api, backend, redis, postgres)

**Environments:**
- `dev` - Development environment (default)
- `release` - Production/Release environment

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start development environment
./setup/manage_netraven.sh start dev

# Reset database in development environment
./setup/manage_netraven.sh reset-db dev

# Restart just the API service
./setup/manage_netraven.sh restart api

# Switch to release environment
./setup/manage_netraven.sh switch-env release
```

This script handles Docker container management, environment configuration, and service health checks, making it the recommended way to interact with the NetRaven development environment.
