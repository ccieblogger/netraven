# Job Tracking and Notification System Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a robust job tracking and notification system for the NetRaven application. The system provides real-time monitoring of scheduled job execution, detailed logging of job status and progress, and configurable notifications to keep users informed about their job outcomes.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Service Layer

- **Job Tracking Service** (`job_tracking_service.py`)
  - Tracks active job execution
  - Provides detailed logging and metrics
  - Implements error handling and retry logic
  - Collects job statistics for reporting

- **Notification Service** (`notification_service.py`)
  - Sends email notifications for job completion/failure
  - Supports user notification preferences
  - Provides templated notification messages
  - Configurable from environment variables

- **Scheduler Service Integration** (`scheduler_service.py`)
  - Updated to work with job tracking service
  - Links scheduled jobs to tracking and notifications
  - Ensures proper job status updates

### 2. API Layer

- **Job Logs Router Enhancements** (`job_logs.py`)
  - Added `/job-logs/active` endpoint for active job tracking
  - Added `/job-logs/statistics` endpoint for job statistics
  - Includes permission controls and logging

- **User Preference Management** (`users.py`)
  - Added notification preferences to user model
  - Created API endpoint for updating notification settings
  - Implemented preference validation

### 3. Database Layer

- **Schema Updates**
  - Added `notification_preferences` column to `users` table
  - Created migration scripts for database updates
  - Added proper indexes for performance

### 4. Documentation

- **Implementation Documentation**
  - Created this summary document
  - Added README for the notification system
  - Updated project planning documents

## Future Enhancements

1. **UI Layer Implementation**
   - Job monitoring dashboard
   - Notification preference configuration UI
   - Real-time status updates using WebSockets

2. **Additional Notification Channels**
   - Slack integration
   - SMS notifications
   - Web push notifications

3. **Enhanced Reporting**
   - Job success rate trends
   - Performance metrics
   - Advanced filtering and analytics

## Deployment

To deploy these changes:

1. Run the database migration:
   ```bash
   ./run_migration.sh
   ```

2. Restart the API service:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart api
   ```

3. Test the new endpoints:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://api.netraven.local/job-logs/active
   ```
